/**
 * What's New - post-update announcement content and display rules
 *
 * A growing archive of release-note items, each stamped with the version it
 * shipped in. The modal shows only the CURRENT release's items, once, on the
 * first launch after a store update (never on fresh installs).
 *
 * Maintenance ritual (every store release):
 * 1. Stamp items shipping in this release with the release's version, and move
 *    WHATS_NEW.version to match - the modal shows nothing unless it equals the
 *    installed version, which is what makes step 5 true
 * 2. Leave drafted future items at version: null (parked, never shown)
 * 3. When a parked item ships, stamp it with that release's version
 * 4. Prune the archive past MAX_WHATS_NEW_ARCHIVE entries (oldest first)
 * 5. A release with no newly stamped items silent-ships automatically
 *
 * Display rules:
 * - Shows ONLY the current release's items, never accumulated history -
 *   skipped intermediate versions are dominated by the final feature state
 * - `platform` declares an item's availability: Apple/Android glyphs render
 *   in the item's leading column (both stacked for cross-platform items) -
 *   informational on every device, never a filter
 * - `version` and `flags` ARE filters: items stamped with another release,
 *   parked (null), or gated behind a disabled feature flag are removed
 *   (VISIBLE_WHATS_NEW), so a dark or future feature is never advertised
 *
 * @see ai/adr/012/ADR.md

// CONTENT - grow per release; prune past MAX_WHATS_NEW_ARCHIVE
//
// WHETHER A RELEASE GETS A MODAL IS AN EDITORIAL DECISION, and it is the owner's
// (ruling 2026-09-13). A real feature is worth interrupting someone for; a
// performance pass is not, and popping a modal for one just annoys people.
//
// So: move `version` (and the item stamps) to the shipping release when you want
// the modal to appear, and LEAVE THEM BEHIND when you do not. A stamp older than
// the installed version is how a release silent-ships, and that is a choice, not
// a bug. Deliberately NOT covered by a test — a test here would fail every time
// that choice is made, which is the fastest way to get the guard deleted.

/**
 * Decides whether the What's New modal should be displayed
 *
 * The modal shows when the bundled notes were stamped for the running binary
 * AND the shown-version differs from the installed version:
 * - Fresh installs seed the shown-version to the installed version at first
 *   boot (see stores/version.ts handleAppUpgrade), so they never differ
 * - Existing users upgrading have an older (or absent) shown-version
 * - Users skipping versions still see only the installed version's notes -
 *   there is no history to accumulate by construction
 *
 * The stamp check is what makes step 5 of the maintenance ritual above true.
 * `app/index.tsx` heads the modal with the INSTALLED version, while the items
 * are filtered against the hand-maintained `WHATS_NEW.version`. Nothing
 * compared the two, so once releases shipped past the last stamp every upgrade
 * presented that old release's items under today's version number - notes the
 * user had already read, dated as if they were new. A release whose stamp has
 * not been moved forward now silent-ships, as the file has always documented.
 *
 * @param installedVersion - Version of the running binary (e.g. '1.13.0')
 * @param shownVersion - Version the modal was last shown for (or seeded with)
 * @param whatsNew - Bundled release content (null = silent release)
 * @returns true if the modal should be displayed now
