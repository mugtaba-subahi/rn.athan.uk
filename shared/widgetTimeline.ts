/**
 * Pure timeline builder for the Athan iOS widgets (standard + extras pairs).
 *
 * Builds timeline entries from a prayer sequence (one entry per prayer
 * boundary) for WidgetKit to render. WidgetKit cannot tick custom-format
 * text, so the countdown — which must mirror the app's exact formatTime
 * style — is precomputed per entry and refreshed by stepped entries every
 * five minutes (WidgetKit's minimum entry spacing) within a 24-hour
 * horizon; beyond it, entries flip only at prayer boundaries. The progress
 * bar stays live on its own between entries via SwiftUI timer intervals.
 *
 * Schedule-agnostic: the same loop serves both the Standard sequence (home
 * + Lock widgets) and the Extra sequence (extras home + Lock widgets); only
 * the day-list assembly differs — Standard rows stay chronological while
 * Extra rows sort into canonical EXTRAS_ENGLISH order (Istijaba last on
 * Fridays), mirroring the two app pages. Every entry stamps its schedule
 * and the caller's theme so the layouts can branch (the extras medium pill
 * renders rose; the theme selects the palette).
 *
 * Pure module: no React Native imports — deterministic and unit-testable.
 *
 * @see widgets/PrayerWidget.tsx - home screen widget layouts (both schedules)
 * @see widgets/LockPrayerWidget.tsx - Lock Screen widget layouts (both schedules)
 * @see stores/widget.ts - IO layer that pushes built entries to the widgets
