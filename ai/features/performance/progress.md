# Performance Campaign — Progress Tracker

> AI-generated task tracker. Updated every iteration. Resume here after any interruption.

## State

- **Branch**: `perf/testing` (from `fix/background-scheduling` @ 1.18.9)
- **Phase**: s10 QUEUE COMPLETE (session 11): #20 CLOSED — per-element overlay shipped + pixel
  parity + countdown merge + boundary recordings + idle gate + campaign wrap (ADR-014 →
  Implemented, AGENTS.md §Performance Design Rules now 12 + campaign-closure Recent Decisions
  entry). REMAINING: the owner's iOS EYEBALL pass = the final acceptance gate (XS rebuilt
  2026-09-06 16:32, Release gate-ON; row-shadow question pre-answered in code —
  ActiveBackground carries SHADOW.prayer natively) + the owner's commit ritual (working tree:
  the s10.1 countdown-merge code + docs, uncommitted per directive; jest 931/931).
- **Builds**: Android = resting build 21 (16:27:39, gate-ON, mock byte-identical to HEAD) on
  the 3T; the S10 BASELINE commit ab3ab7c (1.19.0) is superseded on-device by the s10.1 code.
  iOS = Release gate-ON rebuilt + installed + launched on the XS (16:32, BUILD SUCCEEDED).
- **Device state (end of s11)**: 3T healthy (~31% process band, battery full, keep-awake on),
  app foreground, overlay closed after the idle-gate runs. XS: fresh 1.19.0+s10.1 install
  launched once (16:32:47).
- **Baseline evidence dir**: `ai/features/performance/baseline/` (Phases 1+2); s7 evidence in
  /var/folders/.../T/opencode/perf12/; s9 in perf20/ + e2e/evidence/{overlay-open,overlay-open-dim,
  open-final}-*; s10/s11 evidence in /var/folders/.../T/opencode/perf21/{s101,s102,s103}/
  (s101 = merge frames+vision, s102 = boundary takes a/b5/c + vision reads, s103 = idle atrace).
- **Standing owner directives**: 3T is THE verification device (3T-only testing; iOS = owner eyeball);
  FPS-first evidence; 30fps FLOOR for big animations (per-second countdown text exempt); quality over
  speed; physical devices only; Release builds; no store deployments; never sleep >15s in one command;
  no commits (owner's ritual incl. version bump); iOS widgets + notification semantics measure-only;
  iterate the vision subagent config when delegation friction appears. S9 ADDITIONS: the finished
  overlay must be VISUALLY IDENTICAL / pixel-perfect to the original (owner bar — frame evidence is
  the arbiter); CHALLENGE owner proposals explicitly (owner directive — don't rubber-stamp); minimal
  animated-element count preferred (drove the bands-vs-per-element decision); perf-test EVERY change
  as we go.

### HANDOFF RULE (read first)

**This file is the single source of truth for resuming.** Update it at EVERY milestone — any
session must be able to resume from it cold. The owner resumes with: *"Resume the performance
campaign: read ai/features/performance/ and execute the resume protocol."*

## Tooling (installed 2026-09-05)

| Tool | Version | Path / notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Maestro | 2.10.0 | `~/.maestro/bin/maestro` (add to PATH per shell) |
| Flashlight | latest | `~/.flashlight/bin/flashlight` (Android-only measurement) |
| xctrace | Xcode | iOS profiles on the physical XS |
| adb | — | Android 3T (`8f7ada76`), keep-awake: `svc power stayon usb` (set) |
| opensrc | — | package source reads |
| docs-mcp | — | `react-native@0.86.3` (exact), `react@19.2.8`, `expo`, `react-native-reanimated`, `react-native-worklets`, `react-native-pager-view` indexed |

## Phase checklist

### Phase 0 — Setup
- [x] Branch `perf/testing` created
- [x] Maestro + Flashlight installed
- [x] Android keep-awake (`svc power stayon usb`, timeout 30 min confirmed)
- [x] `app.config.ts`: env-driven name suffix (defaults byte-identical)
- [x] iOS Auto-Lock → Never (owner confirmed done)
- [x] iOS signing set up (owner in Xcode; Team `9V3WAU9Z54`; dev cert created)
- [x] Devices PURGED of all Athan-related apps (owner instruction 2026-09-05):
      Android removed `com.mugtaba.athan` (Play), `com.mugtaba.athan.bgtest` (campaign soak),
      `com.muji.bareexpo`, `com.muji.barealarm`, `com.muji.barealarm36`;
      iOS removed `com.mugtaba.athan` (TestFlight 1.18.1). Both fully clean.
- [x] opencode.json: Maestro MCP + XcodeBuildMCP added (active after opencode restart)
- [x] Android Release build + install on 3T (build #4: v1.18.9, original id, verified via pm list)
- [x] iOS Release build + install on XS (BUILD SUCCEEDED; devicectl install OK)
- [x] Smoke-launch both: Android UI verified via Maestro AX tree (countdown live, London data
      synced, no dialogs). iOS launched via devicectl; first-launch notif prompt auto-granted
      via Maestro `launchApp.permissions` — NOTE see iOS automation caveat in Log.
- [x] Maestro sees both physical devices (MCP `list_devices`: `8f7ada76` + `00008020-…` both
      connected; CLI `list-devices` only prints simulators — use MCP or `--device <udid>`)

### Phase 1 — Baseline capture (BEFORE any change)
- [x] 1.1 Cold/warm/bg-relaunch starts ×10 per device (baseline/1.1-launch-timings.md:
      Android cold 3668/warm 83/bg 91; iOS cold 2693/warm 1217/bg 1206 ms medians)
- [x] 1.2 Interaction suite (baseline/1.2-interactions-android.md + -ios.md:
      Android jank% sheets 43/toggles 24/overlay 70/swipes 38/sounds 66;
      iOS sheet-open 2110ms / overlay 2119ms / swipe 1005ms medians)
- [x] 1.3 Spam suites + blocked-time measurement (1.3-spam-blocked.md: 0 ANRs both
      platforms; Android sound-spam jank 89.3%; iOS toggle/sound spam doubles AX latency)
- [x] 1.4 Thread profiles (1.4-profiles.md: iOS launch = 623-796ms system floor +
      ~1.1-1.6s JS gap; iOS spam = Hermes + shadow-tree slicing + Yoga; **Android idle
      CPU 49-90% — headline finding**)
- [x] 1.5 Behavior snapshot (1.5-behavior.md: jest **918**/918 green — suite grew from
      876; live assertion flows green; quirks recorded incl. back-closes-both-sheets)
- [x] Baseline report written to `baseline/baseline.md` (+ per-phase md files)

### Phase 2 — Instrumentation
- [x] `react-native-performance@6` dep (owner approved deps) — 6.0.0 exact-pinned
- [x] `shared/perf.ts` ring buffer → MMKV + pino, `EXPO_PUBLIC_PERF_MONITOR` gate
      (600-entry ring → `perf-monitor` MMKV instance + single-line `PERF_MEASURE`/`PERF_MARK`
      pino stream; separate MMKV id — app schema untouched)
- [x] Marks on every action path; validated against Phase 1 external numbers
      (baseline/2-instrumentation-validation.md — all marks fire, durations sane and
      cross-validated; two baseline-harness false-positives found and documented)
- [x] Zero-cost gate OFF: statically folded (`void 0==="1"` in bytecode), 0 PERF lines on
      device, cold-start parity with baseline (3555/3612 vs 3668 median)
- [x] jest 918 baseline preserved: 925/925 green (7 new perf.ts tests), tsc + biome clean

### Phase 3 — Iterative optimization (open-ended; one change per iteration)
Ordered backlog (from code dive; re-prioritize by measured impact):

| # | Target | Status | Measured before | Measured after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Startup/splash: defer non-critical init post-first-frame | **done (s1: widget push off critical path)** | iOS js_to_content 1361-1451; Android 978-1077 / ThisTime 3668 | iOS **134 median** (−90%); Android 996-1020 / ThisTime 3512-3642 (unchanged, expected — widget call is iOS-only no-op) |
| 2 | Sheet-dismiss burst: defer reschedule+pushes past animation | **done (s4)** | iOS dismiss awaited widget push: ~1.1-1.4s burst on the home reveal; sound_commit 117 (d) | iOS: close 654 → commit **56ms** → widget push 1383ms starts ~530ms LATER (post-paint); Android commit 157ms, close 254ms, widget_push 0 (no-op) |
| 3 | Unmount closed-Overlay subtree (SVG glow + ticking Countdown) | **done (s4) — REGRESSED OPEN ANIMATION (owner-reported, see #11)** | closed overlay burned 1 Countdown render/s + subtree; overlay_open 180/34 (d/i) | Android idle **16.1%** process (from ~20-24); overlay_open 155/52 (d/i, mount included — FASTER than pre-mount commit); close fade intact |
| 11 | **FIX #3 REGRESSION: overlay open animation jank** — countdown scale-up snaps/jitters on open (both platforms; Android 3T very bad), close scales down smoothly. Fresh subtree mount (glow SVG + gradient + Countdown) commits in the same frames the scale/fade animations play. Must restore 1:1 smooth open WHILE keeping #3's idle win. Candidates: pre-mount inert-hidden subtree, cheapen the mount, sequence animation start after mount settles | **fix VERIFIED (s6)**: pre-mounted subtree + display:none visibility latch. ALL FOUR conditions PASS: first-open (11 frames 16-17ms, vision-confirmed monotonic 0.76→1.0 scale+fade, no snap/ghost; the ~116ms tap→commit stall moved BEFORE visible animation = invisible), first-close (10 frames 60fps vision-confirmed), steady-open (18 frames 16-17ms vision-confirmed), steady-close (SF-latency 60fps cadence, zero >33ms gaps) | owner report 2026-09-06 (s4 end): open = frame-snap jitter, close = smooth | steady opens 162-230 / closes 155-237ms marks across 10+ cycles; js_to_content 1058/1084/1170 (996-family preserved) |
| 12 | **NEW (s5, owner-reported): Alert-sheet selection pill squash** — the purple segmented-control indicator first-frames ~2px wide on the LEFT edge (x≈104) during the sheet entrance for ~50-80ms, then pops to full width. Root cause (vision-confirmed on 3T): width lived INSIDE the Reanimated worklet (async-applied) so the view first-frames at intrinsic 0+2×1px borders; init translateX snap ran in a post-paint useEffect. | **fix VERIFIED PIXEL+VISION (s7 CLOSED)**: static render-time width + useDerivedValue first-eval snap. Post-reboot video capture restored (6-frame swipe test OK); 5s recording of the entrance: pill bbox **w=289 full-width from its FIRST visible frame** (f_0011, mid-slide), stays 289×97-99 through the slide and settled; vision confirms full rounded capsule (row-taper profile, ~96% fill) in every frame, no sliver ever. | 3T screenrecord (s5, pre-fix): pill w≈4px for 3-5 frames (t=1.984-2.018), full w=288 from t=2.05 | post-fix (s7): w=289 from first visible frame, 0 sliver frames; evidence perf12/frames+pill |
| 13 | **NEW (s5 finding): Alert-sheet entrance ~12fps effective on 3T** — 235ms + 202ms frame gaps during the slide-up (7 frames over 570ms). Owner's 30fps floor applies to sheet entrances. Re-assess after #12 lands; if still <30fps, its own iteration (likely mount-churn during entrance — same class as #11) | **FIXED + PASSES FLOOR (s6, resolved by #12+#10)**: post-#10 build atrace: entrance = PERFECT 16.2-17.8ms cadence throughout, every doFrame ≤4.6ms, ZERO >33ms misses (pre-fix: 235/202ms gaps; intermediate post-#12: 28+11ms worst) | atrace_sheet2.txt (35.0ms worst) → atrace_sheet3.txt (zero misses) | 06:19 mark sheet_alert_open 461ms |
| 4 | Tick consolidation (3 store + 3 hook + 2 interval timers) | **done (s4)** | 6 timer chains + 6 TICK logs/s; 3 hook setStates + 6 Countdown renders/s | **2** timer chains (std+extra store only; overlay on-demand), 0 log lines/s, 3 renders/s |
| 5 | RamadanDecorations: gate infinite animations behind visibility | **done (s4, with Bar phantom fix)** | Android idle main-thread 93.1% / process 80.6% (top) | main **16.6%** / process **43.7%**; iOS idle ≈0% (time-sample) |
| 6 | Sound sheet: memoize rows against status ticks | **done (s4)** | session-3: sound open 834 (Android); status ticks re-rendered all 32 rows | warm open **298** (Android); iOS playback CPU ≈0 (1/1789 Running samples); only playing row re-renders, on integer-second changes |
| 7 | Hot-path pino call-site gating (TICK ×5/s, database ops) | **done (s4 — TICK lines; MMKV lines deferred)** | 6 TICK debug lines/s (pino-pretty + logcat) | 0 (call sites deleted; 'TICK: transition' kept — rare) |
| 8 | MMKV pre-computation audit (cache derived work, expiry policy) | **done (s6) — no action warranted**: pino is FULLY DISABLED in prod/preview (shared/logger.ts isLoggingEnabled) so the MMKV info lines have zero production cost — they only pollute dev-env campaign builds (the documented shared confound); derived-work audit found no hot-path recompute (widget timeline cache landed pre-campaign-Phase-3; prayer/notification reads are boundary/user-action cadence, N+M getAllWithPrefix bounded ~30 keys) | dev-env: ~100-400 MMKV lines per launch (mock refresh flood) | n/a — production-clean by construction |
| 9 | Toggle write path (only if Android numbers demand) | **done (s6) — closed, numbers never demanded**: toggle marks healthy across the campaign (it2: toggle jank 24.4% baseline → no complaints post-it5/it6 builds; toggle_tap marks fire; no Android write-path signal) | | |
| 10 | NEW: render-granularity gate — Countdown re-renders per second even when displaying minutes (showSeconds off) | pending | | |
| 14 | NEW (s6, owner directive): visibility-gated rendering audit — (a) underlay beneath the OPEN overlay (invisible → still fully rendered?), (b) static always-mounted components (should they render/update at all), (c) off-screen sheet content, (d) BOTH pager page countdowns tick while one page visible (owner example: warm-but-idle-cheap — subscriptions stay live so reveal needs no compute, but no renders while unseen; same principle as #11's pre-mounted overlay), (e) the phantom 60fps Choreographer loop found in s6 atrace (239 doFrames/4s at idle, ~1.1ms each ≈ 6-7% CPU) + per-second 6.7+12.4ms layout bumps (Bar width update family). CONSTRAINT (owner): the overlay fade must composite over LIVE underlay — no instant teardown during fade-in (would jitter); everything must be precomputed BEFORE an animation begins (never compute during it). CPU + RAM holistic. | **CLOSED (s7) — phantom is UPSTREAM; audit items done/subsumed**: BISECT (7 Release builds, fresh-process atrace each): A sheets unmounted → loop persists; B + overlay subtree unmounted → persists; C + Countdown/Ago animated styles made static → persists; D + sequence tickers disabled → persists; E entire app content blanked (bare View after loading) → persists; F + all providers/SystemBars removed → persists; G literally `<View>` as the whole layout → **persists (303 doFrames/5s, input+animation phases every frame, "doframeadd" tag — not in RN core source, not in any .so/.dex string)**. Conclusion: the loop lives at the RN-0.86.3/Expo-57/Reanimated-4.5.1 runtime level on Android 9/SD820, BELOW all app code; isolated cost on the blank build = 22.5% CPU (top). Revisit on framework upgrades or file upstream with the bisect table. Audit items: (a) SUBSUMED by #20 (in-place overlay = no underlay duplication; the live-underlay constraint is in the brief §2.5); (b) static components render zero at idle (s6: zero traversals 5s, re-verified post-restore: 1/5s); (c) closed sheets fully unmount (@gorhom modal dismiss) — the sound sheet's re-mount cost is the known 600ms; (d) both pages' countdowns subscribe to render-granular derived atoms (#10) — they tick in the STORE (boundary correctness) but render only on displayed-string change. INCIDENT + RECOVERY (transparent): mid-bisect a `git checkout --` on 6 files reverted UNCOMMITTED campaign changes (no commits exist on perf/testing by directive); recovered by reconstruction from session context + intact consumers + campaign tests (index/_layout/Overlay rewritten verbatim from reads; Countdown/Ago re-derived; stores/countdown.ts #4/#7/#10 fully reconstructed against the 928-test suite) — **all 928 tests green + on-device re-verification: js_to_content 1076, overlay_open 74-89ms, idle traversals ~0 — campaign numbers reproduced**. Synology APFS snapshots exist (mount requires owner sudo) — not needed in the end | s6: 239 doFrames/4s ≈ 6-7% | s7: persists at bare-View level (upstream); 22.5% isolated cost |
| 15 | NEW (s7, owner report post-reboot): LAUNCH SLOW — first launch ~9s, second ~5s (owner expects <1s). NOTE: campaign builds are dev-env (mock API + pino enabled) and post-reboot launches are dexopt/cold-cache inflated; campaign-measured ThisTime was 3481-4462 cold / 76-100 warm with js_to_content 1058-1170. A 5s SECOND launch is above the campaign band — re-measure cold/warm ×N post-reboot with marks + ThisTime and determine real vs environmental; root-cause if a regression (suspects: nothing obvious from #10/#11 — derived atoms are lazy, overlay subtree display:none) | **MEASURED + EXPLAINED (s7, no regression)**: post-reboot 3T, build 07:41:44 (#16 fix build): cold ×5 ThisTime 3537-3622 / js_to_content 1047-1056 — squarely IN the campaign band. warm ×5 (process alive, HOME→am start) ThisTime **68-93ms** — the 76-100 band, NOT regressed. The owner's ~9s first = post-reboot dexopt (documented); the ~5s "second launch" = the process had been KILLED between launches (Android 9 RAM pressure kills backgrounded apps; verified ProcessRecord alive right after HOME, but overnight/sitting = killed) → another COLD launch: 3.5s ThisTime + ~0.5-1s to fully-interactive JS ≈ the felt 4.5-5s. Cold decomposition (logcat wall + marks): ~1.8s pre-JS (fork+activity+bundle read) + 0.41s module-eval + 0.3s dev-env mock fetch + ~1.0s first content commit (js_to_content). LEVERS (known, now unblocked): chrome defer (BottomSheet×3 + Overlay mount at root inflates first commit) + module-eval trim; dev-env confound = ~0.3-0.5s of every cold launch (mock refresh + pino flood) that production never pays. Owner's <1s goal needs those levers + production build; queued as future work after this session's queue | owner eyeball 2026-09-06 post-reboot | s7: cold 3537-3622/1047-1056, warm 68-93 |
| 16 | NEW (s7, owner report — REGRESSION): prayer-list text width JITTER on app open — the English prayer-time text visibly jumps/settles on launch ("width not cached like we previously had"). NOT present pre-campaign. Regression hunt: frame-capture the launch (video capture should be restored post-reboot), bisect the cause (suspects: row layout re-settling when sequence/date hydrates, font load, countdown display string arriving late via #10's derived atom, InitialWidthMeasurement) | **FIXED + VERIFIED (s7)**: ROOT CAUSE (instrumented build + logcat + vision): `clearAllExcept` (mock-refresh wipe, EVERY dev-env launch; also year-boundary refresh + upgrade path in prod) DELETED the `prayer_max_english_width_*` MMKV keys — the write-once width cache (owner: names+font are constants, never recompute) was being wiped, so the atom initialized 0 → rows first-painted with English column clipped to padding (width-0: English gone, Arabic −80px, time −40px for 1+ frames) → InitialWidthMeasurement re-measured ~380ms later → visible reflow/settle. Which launch ate the jitter was a race (atom-first-read vs wipe). FIX: `'prayer_max_english_width_'` added to BOTH keep-prefix whitelists (stores/sync.ts:162 + stores/version.ts UPGRADE_KEEP_PREFIXES) + both jest whitelist assertions updated (928/928). VERIFIED (3T, build 07:41:44): `MMKV KEPT: [...prayer_max_english_width_standard, ...extra...]`, zero DELETE lines; 52-frame launch capture = monotonic fade, zero reflow bumps; VISION: all 6 rows × 4 elements at pixel-identical positions through the whole entrance (cross-correlation shift=0 vs settled, alpha-unblended) | owner eyeball 2026-09-06; pre-fix evidence perf12/launch (one-frame reflow: English gone, arabic −80, time −40) | post-fix perf12/launch2: 0.00 diff-to-settled by frame 41, no transient |
| 17 | NEW (s7, owner report): TAP→ACTION LATENCY — haptic fires immediately on prayer-item tap but the overlay takes ~500-700ms to visibly start; same ~500ms for the alert sheet after its icon tap. Campaign marks measured overlay_open 170-230ms (tap→effect) + ~116ms pre-animation stall; owner-perceived gap is larger post-reboot. Measure tap→first-visible-frame precisely (video + marks aligned), decompose (input→JS→commit→first animation frame), close the gap | **PARTIAL FIX LANDED (s7) — overlay path ~2.3x faster commit**: DECOMPOSITION (true-fidelity taps via raw kernel sendevent on the synaptics s3320 touchscreen, one-shell date-bracketed): tap-up→JS handler ≈ **130ms** (RN input dispatch + Pressable responder on SD820 — device floor, not app code); JS commit+effect (overlay_open mark) was **168-203ms**; +1 vsync to fade start ≈ ~325ms tap→animation + ~60-100ms fade-perceptibility ≈ the felt ~400ms+ (owner's 500-700 includes post-reboot system load). ROOT CAUSE of the fat commit: EVERY prayer row component (Prayer+Time+Alert ×12 rows + overlay copy ≈ 37 components) subscribed to the whole `overlayAtom` object — one tap re-rendered all of them. FIX: `stores/atoms/overlay.ts` gains `overlayIsOnAtom` (derived boolean — Countdown/Bar/Ago) + `getOverlaySelectedAtom(type,index)` (module-cached derived per-row selection atom — Prayer/Time/Alert); a toggle now re-renders only the rows whose selection flipped + overlay + isOn consumers. MEASURED (3T, build 08:03:14): overlay_open **61-89ms** across 5 cycles (was 168-203; baseline 162-230) → tap→animation ≈ 210ms, perceived ≈ 270-310ms. Alert-sheet path = #18's durations work. Input→JS 130ms floor documented. jest 928/928, biome+tsc green. Frame-quality re-audit folded into #18's video pass | owner eyeball 2026-09-06 | overlay_open 168-203ms → **61-89ms** |
| 18 | NEW (s7, owner report): SHEET SPEED + CHOREOGRAPHY — (a) sheets close slowly with a slow-down at the very end (spring settle tail) — want faster closes AND haptic feedback earlier on close (notify completion); (b) settings → "Change athan" CLOSES settings THEN OPENS sound serially — want concurrent close+open; (c) sheet OPEN entrances feel slow (~500ms springs) — consider tightening durations across BottomSheetModal configs. Behavior stays 1:1 in effect (faster ≠ different); springs/durations are the levers | **DONE + VERIFIED (s7)**: (1) ROOT CAUSE of the tail: @gorhom default Android config = 250ms `Easing.out(Easing.exp)` — exponential tail drags the settle. FIX: Sheet.tsx passes `SHEET_ANIMATION_CONFIGS` = Android `{200ms, Easing.out(Easing.cubic)}` / iOS tightened spring `{damping 42, stiffness 500, mass 1}`. MEASURED: open_anim marks 152-200ms; close visual cluster ~115-150ms; alert-OPEN/CLOSE + settings-OPEN cadence ALL 16-17ms (60fps, floor PASS with headroom); plain close no longer settles slowly (cubic-out has no asymptote). (2) Close haptic EARLIER: new Sheet prop `closeHaptic` fires in onAnimate when the close STARTS (back/backdrop/swipe/programmatic — all paths); the three screens' onDismiss handlers no longer fire it at completion (Settings Medium, Sound Medium, Alert Light — same styles as before). (3) Change-athan CONCURRENCY: root-caused TWO serializers — the 150ms setTimeout (removed: hideSettingsSheet() + showSheet() same tick) and the lib's default `stackBehavior='switch'` (unmounts-then-presents; Sound sheet now `stackBehavior='push'`). Marks confirm sound_present + settings_close_start fire the SAME ms. RESIDUAL (owner-accepted s7): the sound sheet's animation still starts ~600ms after present because @gorhom unmounts modal content on every dismiss and re-mounting the 32 SoundItems is JS-thread work; owner directive: keep rendering ALL 32 rows (static, fixed, minimal — NO virtualization/lazy-load/FlashList). Net UX: tap → settings drops immediately → sound rises after its mount. (4) open durations tightened via the same config (d subsumed). jest 928/928, biome+tsc green; builds 08:10:12 + 08:20:53. HARNESS: settings "Change athan" row center = (540,1138) on the 3T; pull screenrecord files only after the recording's time limit elapses (moov atom otherwise missing) | owner eyeball 2026-09-06 | open_anim 152-200ms; cadence 16-17ms everywhere; sound animate-start still +600ms (mount-bound, accepted) |
| 19 | NEW (s7, owner report — PRE-EXISTING DEFECT): overlay prayer-row DOUBLE-EXPOSURE jitter — the overlay duplicates the selected prayer row on top of the original; during the overlay's 0→100% fade-in the underlying original row (English name, Arabic name, time, alert icon, active background — BOTH pages) shimmers/jitters because the overlay copy renders a different shade of white → a visible crossfade. Capture frame evidence from every piece (open, held, close), then fix (may be subsumed by #20's re-architecture — sequence: evidence first, then decide) | **EVIDENCE CAPTURED (s7, vision-audited; fix = #20)**: recording perf12/x19 (open on ACTIVE row → close → open on DIM row). PIXELS: Dhuhr band mean 74.2 → **55.7 dip** → 72.1 settled; text max 255 → 190 → 254 (settled ≠ pre-tap: the "different shade"). VISION: at every instant exactly ONE aligned render (no visible double image) — the crossover is TEMPORAL: whole row dims to ~75% at ~100ms (semi-transparent dark overlay layers over the still-bright original while the copy is also ~80%-alpha — a bluish veil, soft halos, zero full-white pixels), then settles as the overlay's own re-render — Latin text pixel-identical but Arabic re-rasterizes ~1.5px shifted + bell 1px wider (the "crawl"). Close = symmetric dip then pixel-perfect original return (XOR 3-19px — underlay never unmounted, Rule-5 compliant). DIM-row open (Asr): smooth monotonic 87→254, NO dip — the in-place AnimColor path is already correct. Owner context folded in: crossover hits text+active-bg+icons alike on both pages; exists ONLY because the overlay duplicates content on top. Root fix = #20 in-place re-architecture (single fade opacity animating the whole stack is structurally incapable of not dimming the underlay mid-fade) | owner eyeball 2026-09-06 | evidence perf12/x19 (74 frames + 6 vision-audited crops) |
| 20 | NEW (s7, owner directive): OVERLAY RE-ARCHITECTURE — attempt a completely different approach: instead of a full-screen absolutely-positioned overlay that DUPLICATES the prayer row/countdown/date (with measureInWindow positioning), dim everything else and highlight the selected prayer + date + countdown IN PLACE using the existing components (top-left glow + fully dark background stay). **OWNER PROCESS DIRECTIVE (s7): split into a PLANNING session first — deep-dive, brainstorm, self-questioning, architectural research, bigger context window — then a BUILD session that implements it, both resuming from this file. THIS session only: capture #19 evidence + write the planning brief (ai/features/performance/overlay-rearchitecture-brief.md) so the planning session starts fully armed.** CRITICAL parity requirements (owner): 1:1 behavior before/after incl. performance testing; tapping an UPCOMING prayer (dim text) must still animate it to bright white (the overlay currently handles this); the overlay countdown (selected prayer, scale 1.5) must survive; overlay z-order/hit-testing 1:1; the underlay must stay live during the fade (no teardown jitter). **REMOVE THE 2s PRE-BOUNDARY LOCK (owner-sanctioned behavior change — the ONE deliberate deviation from 1:1)**: today the overlay auto-closes ~2-3s before the prayer (stores/countdown.ts `overlayMsLeft <= 3000` auto-close) AND refuses to open in that window — the lock exists ONLY because animating the active-background move to the next prayer inside the duplicated overlay tree is hard. With in-place components the cascade/next-prayer transition is just the normal list animation the app already does — the lock becomes unnecessary. GOAL (owner): UI stays fully consistent with the overlay open through countdown-finish/cascade/next-prayer transitions; no auto-close, no open-refusal. Owner s7 context (verbatim intent): the crossover exists ONLY because the overlay sits on top duplicating content — a 100%-white row must STAY 100% through open (no dim-to-50% crossover); a dimmed row animates smoothly from its dim value to 100% (already feels right — the in-place AnimColor path); the SAME crossover hits the active background, alert icons, full text — everything duplicated. Reusing the original mainscreen components in place should eliminate the crossover by construction. | **CLOSED (s10-s11) — SHIPPED as the PER-ELEMENT variant + pixel parity + countdown merge** (ADR-014 Implemented; bands-with-holes superseded after the owner rejected any cutout): per-row schedule-gated hidden atoms + pill/chrome/Masjid fades + VeilBackdrop + box-none catcher + scrollEnabled gate; 2s lock GONE (selection-follows-next-prayer, boundary-verified incl. open-tween collision + Isha→Fajr roll); countdown merged into the page atom (2 timers ever); parity vs original = XOR 0.19% modulo the three sanctioned deltas; owner-confirmed smooth on the 3T; iOS rebuilt for the owner eyeball (row-shadow pre-answered in code).

### Phase 4 — Regression harness
- [x] Maestro flows under `e2e/flows/` (smoke, overlay-x10, sheets-x10, swipes-x15, toggles-x10,
      sounds-x5 — absolute 3T pixels; smoke/overlay/sounds device-validated end-to-end)
- [x] `e2e/scripts/baseline-compare.sh` (marks streaming + median diff vs `e2e/baselines/android-3t.json`)
- [x] `e2e/scripts/frame-audit.sh` (screenrecord → pts → contact sheet → vision prompt; FRAME_AUDIT=sf
      SF-latency fallback for wedged video pipeline)
- [x] `e2e/README.md` (build protocol + every campaign gotcha)

### Phase 5 — Documentation
- [x] `ai/RUNBOOK-performance-testing.md`
- [x] ADR-013: env-gated instrumentation + pre-mounted/display:none overlay + first-frame-settled rules
- [x] AGENTS.md §Performance Design Rules (8 rules)
- [x] ISSUES.md G.6 measurement update
- [x] AGENTS.md Recent Decisions entry

## Constraints (standing)

- Never commit/push (owner's job); version bump per commit is the owner's ritual
- Never sleep >15s in one command — poll builds in ≤15s cycles
- Never reboot devices; keep both plugged in; keep the app alive between measurements
- iOS widgets (`stores/widget.ts`) and notification scheduling semantics: measure +
  document only
- Behavior 1:1: jest suite green after EVERY iteration + final owner smoke test
- No `console.log`; pino via `shared/logger.ts`; Biome clean

## Log

- 2026-09-06 (session 11 END — s10.4 + s10.5 WRAP): iOS rebuilt (Release, gate-ON, xcodebuild
  BUILD SUCCEEDED 16:32, devicectl install + launch OK on the XS) — the owner's eyeball pass is
  the final acceptance gate; row-shadow question PRE-ANSWERED in code: ActiveBackground.tsx:65-70
  carries SHADOW.prayer/SHADOW.prayerExtras + COLORS.shadow.* natively (the old copy's constants —
  iOS renders the real pill's shadow; verify visually at the pass). WRAP: ADR-014 → **Implemented**
  (status rewritten + Implementation Outcome section appended: the pivot history, what shipped,
  the countdown merge, the full §7 checklist results incl. the two supersedes — bands seams n/a,
  iOS owner pass pending); AGENTS.md §Performance Design Rules extended 8 → 12 (mark-semantics
  drift + settled-frame diffs; capture-artifact vetting incl. recorder-t0 drift, encoder drops,
  stale AX dumps, recorder-death-with-shell, device-clock skew; box-none fall-through + pager
  scrollEnabled hit-testing; state-merging over parallel state) + ONE campaign-closure Recent
  Decisions entry; #20 table row → CLOSED; State block rewritten for handoff. Mock restored
  byte-identical (verified vs HEAD). Final battery re-run on the resting tree: jest 931/931,
  tsc clean, biome clean. Working tree (uncommitted, owner's ritual): stores/countdown.ts,
  stores/overlay.ts, components/countdown/Countdown.tsx, shared/types.ts, both test files,
  AGENTS.md, ai/adr/014/ADR.md, progress.md. CAMPAIGN RESUME POINT: owner iOS eyeball → any fix
  queue it produces → owner commit ritual (suggest 1.20.0, minor — completed feature per §6).
- 2026-09-06 (session 11 — s10.2 BOUNDARY RECORDING + s10.3 IDLE GATE: ALL PASS): builds 19-21
  (gate-ON, mock-churned per case, RESTORED byte-identical + final resting build 16:27:39).
  s10.2a (overlay OPEN ~2min, rides Dhuhr→Asr; perf21/s102/rec-a + vision): countdown-finish =
  6s→…→1s hold (never 0s); hero swap ATOMIC at frame granularity (fa_068 "Dhuhr/1s" → fa_069
  "Asr/2h 58m"); store transition 16ms (TICK log); pill slide = the dense 60fps run (70 frames,
  single connected blob, exactly one row-pitch 150px, monotonic, 0.87s, never two/zero pills);
  no veil drop/blink; overlay STILL OPEN after (AX: hero Asr 2h57m31s, highlight advanced,
  catcher frames the Asr row). The coarse "2h 58m" for ~1s = display contract (ceil landed on
  2h58m00s; 0s never renders). s10.2b (NO-OPEN-REFUSAL ≤2s + open-tween/cascade COLLISION;
  rec-b5 + vision over ALL 121 frames): tap at ~1.3s-to-boundary → overlay_open 187ms — the
  old ≤3s lock would have REFUSED; boundary 0.33s later hit WHILE the 500ms scale tween ran;
  all 121 frames exactly one pill + one coherent hero string (three atomic text states 1s →
  2h 58m → 2h 57m 59s), no blink/close; ONE caveat (pre-existing, by design): 2-frame (33ms)
  row-label crossfade dip mid-pill-slide (the s9 150ms row-brighten pace; pill stays opaque —
  the selection indicator never disappears). s10.2c (Isha→Fajr DATE-ROLL; rec-c + vision over
  all 131 frames): 1s hold; hero+DATE swap ATOMIC in the SAME frame (Rabiʻ I 24→25, band
  pixel-identical position); pill flight row 6→row 1 (full 5-row jump) = one rigid 148px band,
  0.82s, decelerating, exactly 1 pill in 131/131 frames; no auto-close (0 overlay_close marks
  all three cases); post-roll AX: hero Dhuhr 20h52m42s, date rolled, highlight on new day's
  Dhuhr row. NOTE: the mock's "next" after Isha is day1 Dhuhr 13:06 (morning prayers precede
  its launch-relative evening Fajr — documented mock shape); mechanics identical. HARNESS
  LESSONS (durable): (1) the 3T clock runs ~3.3s BEHIND the mac — time taps by DEVICE clock
  (adb shell date), never shell arithmetic; (2) a headless BG-task/ALARM respawn can own a
  dev launch (pre-spawned process evaluates the mock's `now` up to ~20s before am start) —
  verify perf_monitor_init lands within ~2s of am start, else force-stop and re-launch; (3)
  mocks/simple addMinutes returns CLOCK STRINGS (seconds truncated) → launch-relative
  boundaries land on clean wall :00 — boundary_dev = (init_mark − ~1.5s + 2m) truncated to the
  minute; tap at boundary−1.2s via tight device-clock compare loop; (4) a bash tool call must
  COMPLETE within its own timeout — background the recorder in one short call, never let a
  wait-loop eat the call (the recorder dies with the killed shell). s10.3 IDLE GATE (final
  resting build, 5s atrace each state): overlay CLOSED = 0 performMeasure / 0 performLayout /
  12 traversals (the per-second countdown TEXT commits — showSeconds is ON on this install,
  the owner-exempt family; s6 measured 0 with seconds off) → ZERO overlay-driven renders while
  closed; overlay OPEN = 7 traversals / 0 / 0, doFrame 301≈305 (the documented upstream phantom
  Choreographer loop) — OPEN ≡ CLOSED cadence, the merge adds NO timer/render cost (process
  ~31% in the established band). NEXT: s10.4 iOS rebuild + owner eyeball (row-shadow question),
  then s10.5 campaign wrap.
- 2026-09-06 (session 11 — s10.1 COUNTDOWN MERGE SHIPPED + VERIFIED): executed queue item 1 on
  baseline ab3ab7c (build 18, 15:12:06, gate-ON). CHANGE: the sequence ticker now writes
  `overlay-open ? selectedTarget : next` directly into the PAGE countdown atom
  (`writeDisplayCountdown` in stores/countdown.ts — per-second from the tick + instantly from
  stores/overlay.ts on open/selection/close; the boundary-restart initial write covers the
  advance); hold-at-1s for a passed display target comes FREE from getSecondsRemaining's
  ≥1 clamp (Math.max(1, ceil)); boundary detection unchanged (always the true next via
  getNextPrayer); overlayCountdownAtom + Name/Display derived atoms + CountdownKey.Overlay +
  Countdown.tsx's dual subscription ALL DELETED — 2 timers ever, enforced by the CountdownKey
  enum type. Zero visual change mandate held: the 1↔1.5 scale/translate tween is
  overlayIsOnAtom-driven, untouched. BONUS FIX (found in review): the baseline's
  startCountdowns() reset the overlay countdown on every foreground-return sync — an open
  overlay's countdown would freeze/0s on foreground return; the merged design is structurally
  immune (no separate overlay countdown exists). Documented edge semantics change (dead edge):
  null overlay target (stale index mid-roll) now falls back to the true next prayer instead of
  the old "Prayer/0s" placeholder — writing 0s into a page atom would violate the display
  contract. VERIFICATION: jest 931/931 (+1 net: merged-target suite — instant-write-while-open,
  true-next-when-closed, hold-at-1s w/ both chains armed, boundary advance now asserted on the
  PAGE atom {2698, Magrib}, other-schedule page atom unhijacked), tsc + biome clean. 3T frames
  (perf21/s101, one 15s take: open-on-PASSED-Fajr → close → reopen-on-NEXT-Dhuhr): all three
  transitions 60fps (open 17f @15-18ms + one 35ms; close 18f consecutive @15-18ms; open2 17f
  @15-18ms + one 34ms) — 30fps floor PASS. VISION (settled + first-anim frames): instant swap
  PASS (first animation frame already reads the selected target at 1.00x — swap precedes all
  animation), ticking-while-open PASS (29h9m10s→7s→4s monotonic; AX live-read 1h34m34s on the
  seamless reopen), close-restore PASS (Dhuhr 1h36m3s, ledger continuous), scale EXACTLY 1.500x
  (78/52px), name never scales, no 0s/blank/ghost/clipping. The vision flag "29h 9m ≠ ~9h" =
  mock by design (day1.fajr addMinutes(310) → tomorrow 20:26; the s4-verified 29h tomorrow-Fajr
  precedent) and "bar missing" = pre-existing Bar.tsx hides-under-overlay — both closed, zero
  defects. Marks: overlay_open 183-215 / close 254 — the post-s9 semantics band (commit-time
  instrument; FRAME EVIDENCE IS THE ARBITER, JS CPU unaffected). Harness note: video-t0↔shell-t
  drift ~0.3-1s; align bursts to logcat mark timestamps, not shell sleep arithmetic (open2's
  burst initially mis-windowed, corrected via the 15:17:02.156 mark). NEXT: s10.2 boundary
  recording (mock edits + rebuilds per case, RESTORE mock after), s10.3 idle atrace, s10.4 iOS
  rebuild + owner eyeball, s10.5 wrap.
- 2026-09-06 (session 10 — #20 PER-ELEMENT SHIPPED + PARITY ACHIEVED): executed the pivot the owner
  approved ("continue as you were" after the cutout objection): bands/veilGeometry hole logic
  DELETED (catcher-only geometry kept, renamed catcherGeometry.ts + tests); Overlay is now a thin
  input layer (box-none container, ADR-013 latch, extras explanation, 4-region catcher); the hiding
  moved per-element — Prayer rows fade via schedule-gated `getOverlayHiddenAtom(type,index)`
  (module-cached; off-screen page stays cold; the selected row's hidden state never flips so it
  re-renders only via its selected-atom path), ActiveBackground pill fades when its row ≠ selected,
  Navigation dots+settings+RamadanDecorations fade via one chrome opacity, Day's Masjid fades
  (location/date logic untouched); VeilBackdrop unchanged. Owner mid-session directives: date stays
  WHITE on the overlay like the normal component (recolor REMOVED — dim location + white date,
  exactly the non-overlay visual); the sanctioned-delta list is exactly THREE (location added, date
  white, date position unchanged) and the owner asked to verify WITHOUT reverting them — done via
  the settled-pair side-by-side. VERIFICATION (all on build 16, 3T): side-by-side vs the ORIGINAL's
  SETTLED frame (x19/x_0022 — NOTE: the earlier "hero 5% larger" finding was a mid-animation
  reference frame; withTiming default is 500ms — always diff settled frames!): PARITY ACHIEVED,
  fix queue empty (hero XOR 0.19% post-1px-align, pill fill (8,71,229)=true #0847e5 + corner radius
  equal, veil shape identical at 6 stations, glow footprint identical, 0 structural diff outside
  sanctioned zones; residual +1-3 RGB = capture-level, present on opaque pixels too). Pixel
  spot-checks: date max (255,255,255), location dim (98,108,160), rows veiled (max 31), dots gone
  (max 2), glow bump +44. Functional smoke: open ✓, row-body close ✓, bell→sheet-over-overlay ✓,
  BACK dismisses sheet ✓, swipe blocked (0.22 diff) ✓. Open animation 60fps (15-18ms; tap→first
  frame ~335ms — the established latency band). jest 930/930 (catcher suite replaced the band
  suite), tsc + biome clean. REMAINING s10 QUEUE: (1) countdown merge — owner-approved design:
  sequence tick writes `overlay-open ? selectedTarget : next` into the PAGE countdown atom
  (immediate write on open/selection/advance; hold-at-1s check for the display target in the merged
  tick; kills overlayCountdownAtom family + Countdown.tsx's dual subscription; 2 timers ever);
  (2) boundary recording + lock-gone on-device (mock ~2min pre-boundary; record THROUGH
  countdown-finish → advance → pill cascade → countdown retarget; Isha→Fajr date-roll case);
  (3) idle-gate atrace (overlay closed = zero overlay-driven renders; per-element must not tick);
  (4) iOS rebuild + owner eyeball (row-shadow question: the copy carried SHADOW.prayer — iOS-only
  effect; the real pill carries the same shadow constants so likely moot — check at eyeball);
  (5) campaign wrap: ADR-014 status → Implemented (per-element variant, superseding the bands
  design), AGENTS.md §Performance lessons (box-none fall-through, pager scrollEnabled gate,
  overlay_open mark semantics = frame evidence is the arbiter, always diff SETTLED frames,
  capture-artifact vetting), #20 row closure.
- 2026-09-06 (session 9 END — HANDOFF): #20 BUILT + DEVICE-VERIFIED on the 3T across 14 builds,
  but the owner's final EYEBALL VERDICT: NOT yet pixel-perfect ("still uses a cutout approach";
  "a lot of inconsistencies"). The device runs build 14 (12:54:31) = bands-with-holes +
  VeilBackdrop — cutout boundaries invisible per pixel audits, but the MECHANISM is a cutout and
  the owner has now twice stated they don't want holes. OPEN ARCHITECTURE DECISION (owner's, make
  it FIRST in s10): **pivot to per-element (recommended by the agent)** — no layer over content;
  non-selected rows + Ago(existing) + Bar(existing) + dots + Masjid fade out; VeilBackdrop STAYS
  (it is what puts surviving content on the veil gradient — load-bearing in BOTH designs); catcher
  (box-none) + scrollEnabled gate STAY (verified); bands/veilGeometry hole logic GOES (keep
  buildCatcherRegions — the catcher still needs the row-exempt rect). The per-element variant was
  fully implemented once this session (git history has it in the session transcript; the diff:
  getOverlayHiddenAtom(type,index) schedule-gated derived atom + AnimatedPressable opacity in
  Prayer + pill fade in ActiveBackground (only when pill's row ≠ selected) + dots wrapper fade in
  Navigation + Masjid wrapper in Day — Day location/date logic unchanged) — re-apply it, ~30 min.
  KNOWN REMAINING DELTAS vs original (fix in s10 regardless of architecture): owner saw
  inconsistencies beyond the audited regions — s10 MUST start with an owner-guided side-by-side
  (reference: /var/folders/.../T/opencode/perf12/x19/x_0015.png = ORIGINAL settled overlay on
  Dhuhr; compare crops hero/day/row/veil vs new screenshots; enumerate every diff and fix with
  owner confirmation). Confirmed-noted deltas so far: location visible on overlay (SANCTIONED —
  owner v2.0 directive), row drop shadow missing on iOS only (copy had SHADOW.prayer; Android
  no-op — check at iOS eyeball), date/row recolor pacing tuned (200/150ms). ALL VERIFIED THIS
  SESSION (carries over to either architecture): stores (lock gone + advance + race-safe tick),
  jest 939/939, hit-test matrix, swipe-block, floor 14-33ms, #19 dip absent, marks-semantics
  lesson (useLayoutEffect instrument in Overlay; frame evidence is the arbiter — overlay_open mark
  window now brackets a sync UI-thread mount wait, JS CPU is only ~44ms). S10 QUEUE after the
  pivot + pixel-parity pass: countdown merge (design settled: sequence tick writes
  overlay-open ? selectedTarget : next into the PAGE atom, immediate write on open/selection/
  advance, hold-at-1s for the display target in the merged tick; kills overlayCountdownAtom
  family + Countdown.tsx dual subscription; 2 timers ever), boundary recording + lock-gone
  on-device (mock ~2min pre-boundary; Isha→Fajr roll case), idle-gate atrace, iOS rebuild, owner
  eyeball = acceptance gate.

- 2026-09-06 (session 9 DETAIL — the build arc through 14 builds): implemented per ADR-014 then
  iterated through owner checkpoints. ARCHITECTURE SHIPPED IN BUILD 14 (bands variant — being
  replaced by the per-element pivot above in s10):
  (1) `components/overlay/Overlay.tsx` = the veil LAYER: opaque gradient BANDS (veilGeometry.ts,
  pure + unit-tested: coverage/disjointness/seam-color contracts) with holes over hero / day-column /
  selected row + the extras explanation + a 4-region press-catcher (row-exempt); ONE animated
  opacity (the original's single-fade mechanism); ADR-013 pre-mount/display:none latch retained.
  (2) `components/overlay/VeilBackdrop.tsx` = the veil's BACKDROP inside the underlay (Navigation,
  above BackgroundGradients, below pager): fullscreen overlay-gradient + the relocated Glow BEHIND
  the hero text (crisp white, not tinted), opacity crossfaded with overlayIsOn — this is what makes
  hole interiors pixel-correct (veil ramp, NOT navy). GOTCHA: Glow's own zIndex -1 sorts it BELOW a
  zIndex-less gradient — the gradient needs zIndex -1 too (tie → document order → glow on top).
  (3) In-place content: hero swaps+1.5x scales (existing), Day shows location (STAYS VISIBLE — owner
  directive, the one sanctioned visual delta) + date content-swap (next-occurrence) + 200ms recolor
  (memoized: hijri formatting is ~expensive on the 3T), Time shows tomorrow's time for passed
  selections (dual usePrayer), rows brighten 150ms (x19 pace). (4) Hit-test parity: container
  `box-none` (RN LESSON: a plain auto View SWALLOWS taps — the row hole needs fall-through to the
  z-lower sibling; empirically matrix-verified) + `scrollEnabled={!overlayIsOn}` on the pager (swipes
  starting IN the row hole otherwise drag the pager — RN lesson: native ViewPager2 intercepts drags
  regardless of JS responders). (5) Lock removed: canShowOverlay + auto-close deleted;
  selection-follows-next-prayer advance in the sequence tick (stores/countdown.ts) + the overlay
  countdown tick now RE-DERIVES its target per tick (a stale closure firing after a boundary
  retarget would otherwise freeze the fresh chain — race found on paper). VERIFIED ON 3T: pixel
  audits (backdrop #0D001A-family inside holes, no detectable hole edges, hero max #FFFFFF @1.50x,
  row pixel-identical, no seams/ghosts/strips, Masjid/dots veiled, status bar veiled, glow +44 blue
  bump after z-fix); frames+vision (open-active: row 255 EVERY frame — #19 dip ABSENT, veil
  monotonic, 15-18ms cadence; open-dim: monotonic rise, hole correct from first frame; close: no
  dip, clean 1.5→1 descale); hit-test matrix (row body closes, bell opens sheet over overlay, BACK
  dismisses sheet leaving overlay, dim-row area closes, swipe blocked + page unchanged, settings
  area closes); jest 939/939 (7 new veilGeometry + rewritten overlay/countdown suites w/ advance
  specs), tsc+biome clean. MID-SESSION DESIGN ARC (owner checkpoints): pixel-perfect directive →
  VeilBackdrop + glow relocation + timing alignment; owner's per-element (no-layer) proposal →
  pivoted, then owner's minimal-animation-count directive → REVERTED to bands (3 animated elements
  vs ~9; band code restored verbatim); owner's hole objection answered with pixel evidence (the
  backdrop makes hole interiors the veil ramp — no navy, no visible rectangle); lazy-page proposal
  SHELVED (off-screen page already ~0 cost post-#10; only cold-start prize; parked in #15's
  chrome-defer pass). **MARKS REGRESSION INVESTIGATION (durable lesson)**: overlay_open
  92.5→~196-200ms after the pixel-parity work; bisected through 5 single-variable builds
  (scrollEnabled, VeilBackdrop, box-none, Day hijri/memos, timing constants) — ALL ELIMINATED;
  atrace proved the JS thread runs only ~44-78ms CPU (max burst 44ms) and SLEEPS the rest — the
  mark's window now brackets a SYNCHRONOUS UI-thread mount wait (JS sleeps, commit waits); frame
  evidence shows USER-VISIBLE PARITY (first anim frame 846ms vs 861ms morning-verified; cadence
  14-33ms, floor held). The overlay_open mark's semantics changed (useLayoutEffect instrument
  added to Overlay for commit-time truth) — CROSS-BUILD COMPARISONS MUST USE FRAME EVIDENCE, not
  this mark. HARNESS NOTES: Maestro stalled once (killed; raw sendevent taps + logcat grep as
  fallback — equally valid for marks); expo run:android sometimes doesn't install post-build
  (watch lastUpdateTime; manual adb install -r). REMAINING (s10): countdown merge (owner-approved:
  sequence tick writes overlay-open ? selectedTarget : next into the PAGE atom; immediate write on
  open/selection/advance; hold-at-1s check for the display target in the merged tick — kills the
  overlay countdown atom family + Countdown.tsx's dual subscription; 2 timers ever), boundary
  recording + lock-gone on-device (mock ~2min pre-boundary), idle-gate atrace re-run, full jest,
  iOS rebuild + owner eyeball.
- 2026-09-06 (session 8 — #20 PLANNING COMPLETE, HANDOFF TO BUILD): **ADR-014 written**
  (`ai/adr/014/ADR.md`) — the overlay re-architecture design. Research: full code dive (Overlay,
  stores/overlay + atoms/overlay + countdown, Prayer/Time/Alert, Countdown/Bar/Ago, List/Day
  measureInWindow, Sheet z-order, both test files); platform verification via TinyFish (RN
  zIndex/elevation = siblings-only → cross-parent row-lifting above a root scrim impossible
  without portals; scrim-cutout precedent space = rect composition vs MaskedView vs native
  hole-view lib → **rect composition, zero new deps**). No device interaction needed this session
  (all behavioral facts code-verified: row-copy tap toggles close, bell opens the alert sheet over
  the overlay, swipe blocked, BACK unhandled, gradient OPAQUE #110022→#000000; frame claims are
  build-session work). DECISIONS: (1) **veil-with-holes** — the root layer keeps ONLY the banded
  opaque gradient (static holes at hero/date/row, reusing today's copy-positioning math +
  one-shot measurements), Glow, extras Explanation, and a 4-region press-catcher; ALL content
  in-place (existing selection atoms, hero swap+scale, Bar/Ago fades untouched; new
  overlay-awareness only in Day date + Time passed-row time). The #19 crossover becomes
  structurally impossible — holes never veil the row, on open AND close. (2) Boundary with the
  2s-lock removed = **selection-follows-next-prayer** (owner delegated the final call: "easiest
  and cleanest"); stick-and-count-tomorrow rejected. (3) Per-element dimming rejected (diffuse,
  approximate). The ADR carries the hit-test/z-order 1:1 matrix, the file-by-file diff plan
  (9 files), and the build parity checklist (jest/marks/frames+vision incl. the
  boundary-crossing recording/idle gate/lock-gone). NEXT SESSION (build): "Resume the campaign:
  read progress.md + ADR-014 and build the overlay re-architecture per the ADR, perf-testing as
  you go." iOS rebuild still pending before the owner's next iOS eyeball pass (s7 note stands).

- 2026-09-06 (session 7 END — HANDOFF): Vision gate passed (subagent correctly read the s6 squashed-pill
  frame). VIDEO CAPTURE RESTORED post-reboot (verified + used all session). #12 CLOSED with pixels+vision
  (pill full-width 289px capsule from first visible frame). #16 FIXED: clearAllExcept wiped the
  prayer_max_english_width_* cache every dev launch (and every year-boundary refresh + upgrade in prod) →
  width-0 first paint → re-measure reflow; fixed in BOTH keep-prefix whitelists (sync.ts + version.ts);
  vision-verified zero reflow. #15: cold 3537-3622/1047-1056 (in-band), warm 68-93ms (in-band) — owner's
  ~5s second launch = process-killed cold restart path, documented. #17: tap decomposition via raw-kernel
  sendevent taps (input→JS ≈130ms device floor; JS commit+effect was 168-203ms) — derived overlay atoms
  (overlayIsOnAtom + getOverlaySelectedAtom) cut the commit to 61-89ms; every-row re-render eliminated.
  #18: @gorhom default Android Easing.out(Easing.exp) tail replaced with 200ms cubic-out (iOS: tightened
  spring) — all sheet animations 16-17ms cadence; close haptics moved to close START (Sheet closeHaptic
  prop); Change-athan now same-tick + stackBehavior='push' (lib's 'switch' unmount-then-present removed);
  residual = sound sheet's 32-row mount ~600ms (owner: keep all 32 rows, NO virtualization). #19: crossover
  fully characterized (row dips to ~75% + bluish 80%-alpha veil + Arabic/bell re-rasterization crawl; dim-row
  path clean) — evidence feeds #20. #20 brief written (see overlay-rearchitecture-brief.md). #14 CLOSED:
  7-build bisect proved the phantom 60fps Choreographer loop UPSTREAM (persists with literally a bare View
  as the whole app; 22.5% isolated cost). INCIDENT: a git checkout during the bisect reverted uncommitted
  campaign changes in 6 files; fully reconstructed + re-verified (928/928 + on-device numbers reproduced:
  js_to_content 1076, overlay_open 74-89ms, idle traversals ~0). LESSON (durable): the campaign NEVER
  commits by directive — bisect work MUST use throwaway file edits that are diffed/reverted individually,
  never `git checkout --` on paths with uncommitted work; consider asking the owner for a WIP-stash ritual
  before risky operations. NEXT SESSION: the #20 PLANNING session (read the brief; design + ADR; no
  implementation), then the BUILD session (perf testing continues during the build). iOS rebuild pending
  before the owner's next iOS eyeball pass (s7 changed shared components: Countdown/Ago/Prayer/Time/Alert/
  sheets/Overlay/countdown-store).

- 2026-09-06 (session 6, continued — #10 IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED): render-granularity gate landed:
  stores/countdown.ts gains primitive-valued DERIVED selectors — per-type countdown name/display-string
  atoms (display re-renders only when the formatted string changes: 1/min with showSeconds off, 1/s in
  the final-10-minutes seconds window or with the preference on — the owner's per-second-text exemption),
  + bar progress quantized to 1px steps (BAR_STEP_PCT = 100/COUNTDOWN_BAR.WIDTH) with an EXACT warning-
  flip boolean (threshold crossing keeps second accuracy); useCountdown returns the display STRING;
  useCountdownBar returns {progress(quantized), isReady, isWarning}; Bar.tsx color assignments driven by
  the derived boolean. The raw atoms still tick 1/s (boundary correctness); derived atoms recompute per
  tick (pure math) but emit only on visible change. 3 new tests (925→928). VERIFIED on 3T (build 06:03:53,
  gate-ON): idle atrace = ZERO traversal/measure/layout sections in 5s (pre-#10: 6.7+12.4ms bumps every
  second); countdown text flips exactly at the minute boundary (10×7px digit-region pixel diff at the
  flip, otherwise static); overlay marks 170/155, sheet_alert 593 healthy; js_to_content 1170 (family).
  Idle top median 19.3% (band unchanged — dominated by the phantom loop below). REANIMATED RESEARCH
  (owner-directed): 4.6.0 is out (bugfix-only, no OperationsLoop perf fixes — not worth mid-campaign
  churn, revisit later); OperationsLoop.cpp/NodesManager.kt read — the Choreographer re-arms while any
  LoopOperation (CSS-only here) OR classic animation/callback is active + a timestamp-cache invalidation
  cycle; PHANTOM 60fps LOOP confirmed on a FRESH process with ZERO interactions (239 doFrames/4s, 1.4ms
  animation-phase each, no layout, no display damage ≈ 6-7% CPU) — NOT Ramadan (gated), NOT @gorhom's
  keyboard/frame callbacks (passive, verified in source), NOT the per-second renders (survives #10).
  Suspects left: an eternally-active classic animation (withTiming-inside-useAnimatedStyle patterns in
  Countdown/Ago re-arm on evaluation — but those complete) or a Reanimated-internal cycle; NEXT: bisect
  build (sheets unmounted env-gated) — parked for Phase 4 companion work. NEW DEVICE GOTCHA: a stale
  Android Studio SCREEN-SHARING agent (app_process com.android.tools.screensharing) was burning 103%
  CPU on the 3T for 140+ CPU-minutes — heating the device (explains much of the screenrecord encoder
  throttling) and skewing CPU medians; killed 06:10, temp 60+→52.5°C falling. iOS: rebuilt+installed
  (05:52, gate-ON verified in bundle strings, widget pushes logged); owner directive mid-session: 3T-ONLY
  testing from here (iOS smoothness owner-eyeballs — same pre-mounted code path).

- 2026-09-06 (session 6, in progress — VISION GATE PASSED): vision subagent (GLM 5.3 Flash) verified
  working end-to-end (correctly identified the squashed-pill frame from perf11/crops). #11/#12 AFTER
  evidence (3T, build 04:49:35): js_to_content **1058** (996-family ✓ — subtree back in startup commit);
  overlay marks open 184-230 / close 173-237 across 9 cycles. FRAME EVIDENCE: **first-open-in-process =
  PASS** (11 frames @16-17ms cadence, monotonic 0.76→1.0 scale + fade, vision-confirmed NO snap/ghosting;
  the ~116ms tap→commit stall now lands BEFORE any visible animation = invisible); **first-close = PASS**
  (10 frames, mirrored, 60fps); **steady-state open = PASS** (18 frames @16-17ms, smooth fade, vision-
  confirmed). Steady-state CLOSE capture pending — device HEAT-SOAKED after ~1h of recording load:
  screenrecord encoder began dropping all animation frames (37→21→5→8→3 frames per recording despite
  16M→8M bitrate and 540x960 downscale) and gfxinfo read 88% janky (device state, not app — 05:10
  evidence was clean). Cooling the 3T (screen off ~5min) before re-capture. NEW HARNESS GOTCHAS: (1)
  ffmpeg frame extraction MUST use `-fps_mode passthrough` (output option, after -i) or VFR screenrecord
  output gets CFR-duplicated (314 PNGs for 37 frames); (2) pace scripted transitions ≥1.2s apart — the
  SD820 encoder drops frames when animations arrive back-to-back (rapid-fire 6-tap batches capture only
  the last animation); (3) Android screen brightness alone can't classify app states — home AND overlay
  are both dark navy; use vision frame classification instead. Owner directive (standing): iterate the
  vision subagent description/prompt in ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json as a clean one-shot spec (no
  changelog) whenever delegation friction appears — first refinement applied (measure-don't-estimate,
  bias inoculation, scale reporting; 205 words).

- 2026-09-06 (session 5, in progress): #11 + #12 implemented, mid-verification. Owner directives this session:
  (a) **3T is THE verification device** — oldest/worst; if smooth there, smooth everywhere; FPS-first evidence.
  (b) **30fps FLOOR for big animations** (overlay, sheets, cascade, segmented selection, prayer-transition UI changes);
  60fps = bonus, not required; per-second countdown text updates exempt (tiny). Prioritize which animations get the budget.
  (c) Full authority + unlimited time granted: re-validate anything from the whole campaign; quality over speed.
  (d) Model switched mid-session to GLM 5.3 Flash (vision capable) — all frame analyses now VISION-VALIDATED, not just
  pixel-script-inferred. A `vision` SUBAGENT (GLM 5.3 Flash, subagent mode, max effort, edit-denied) was added to
  ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json agent{} so future GLM 5.3 sessions can delegate image inspection — active after
  opencode restart. Division of labor: scripts MEASURE (bboxes, pts gaps), vision INTERPRETS (what it looks like).
  EVIDENCE HARNESS (3T, in /var/folders/.../T/opencode/perf11/): screenrecord 6s@16Mbps → ffprobe per-frame pts_time
  (screenrecord only emits frames on DISPLAY CHANGES = real compositor updates; each written frame IS a display update)
  → PIL region analysis + vision on crops. ffmpeg needed a dylib fix: ln -s Cellar/x265/4.1/lib/libx265.215.dylib into
  /opt/homebrew/opt/x265/lib/. BEFORE evidence (build it6, both vision-validated): overlay open = pop + 113ms freeze +
  ghosted double-exposure catch-up (close = clean 60fps 17 frames); alert pill = w≈4px left-edge sliver t=1.984-2.018
  then pop to w=288; alert sheet entrance ~12fps effective (NEW issue #13). FIXES: Overlay.tsx pre-mounted subtree +
  display:none visibility latch (hide deferred past close fade via setTimeout ANIMATION.duration; keeps #3's idle win —
  GONE/hidden skips draw+layout both platforms; overlay ticker stays on-demand); SegmentedControl.tsx width → static
  render-time style + useDerivedValue first-eval snap (Toggle pattern; snap not consumed while optionWidth=0).
  jest 925/925, biome + tsc clean. Android Release gate-ON rebuilt + installed 04:49:35 (first launch discarded 4629ms
  dexopt). AFTER capture #1 (overlay) = SUSPICIOUS/CONFOUNDED — 200/132ms gaps in open window, close caught only 2
  frames, overlay_open mark 218 (was 160): recording started ~5s after cold launch (JS still settling + widget re-push
  ~2.5s) AND first-open-in-process now pays the subtree's FIRST layout+draw (display none→flex). NEXT: redo AFTER
  properly (settle ≥10s, then 3 opens in one recording to separate first-open cost from steady-state); pill AFTER
  capture; idle top medians (expect ~19% band until #10 kills the hidden Countdown's per-second render — accepted,
  sequenced); js_to_content check (subtree back in startup commit — expect ~996/134 family per it1/it3 numbers);
  iOS rebuild + marks; then #13 assessment, #10, #8. opencode.json (project) unchanged this session.

- 2026-09-06 (session 4 end, owner feedback): **REGRESSION from iteration 5 (#3)** — the overlay
  OPEN animation is janky on both platforms (3T very bad, XS noticeable): the hero countdown's
  scale-up to 1.5 snaps/jumps frames instead of animating smoothly; the CLOSE still scales down
  smoothly. Root-cause hypothesis: with the latched unmount, opening mounts the whole subtree
  (Glow SVG + LinearGradient + Prayer row + Countdown) in the SAME frames the scale/fade
  animations play — the mount commit (JS render + shadow tree + native view creation) starves
  the animation frames. Close is smooth because the tree is already mounted. This violates the
  behavior-1:1 rule → backlog #11 is the FIRST item of the next session. The fix must restore
  the pre-#3 smooth open while keeping the idle win (candidates: pre-mount an inert hidden
  subtree with no per-second subscriptions; cheapen/lighten the mount; or start animations only
  after the mount commit settles). overlay_open marks alone won't catch this — it measures
  store.set→effect, not animation frame quality; verify with screencap frame stepping or
  owner's eyes (owner confirmed they can see it on both devices).

- 2026-09-06 (session 4, iteration 6): sheet-dismiss burst (#2).
  ROOT CAUSE: `_rescheduleAllNotifications` AWAITED `refreshPrayerWidgets()` — on iOS the two
  timeline builds+pushes cost ~1.1-1.4s and ran inline in every foreground reschedule path,
  landing exactly on the sheet-dismiss home reveal (the "burst"). The dismiss handlers
  themselves already run post-animation (BottomSheetModal.onDismiss) — the awaited push was
  the burst.
  CHANGE: stores/notifications.ts — `_rescheduleAllNotifications({deferWidgetRefresh})`:
  foreground paths (`rescheduleAllNotifications` — sheet commits; `refreshNotifications` —
  foreground gate) fire the widget push via rAF + setTimeout(0) past the next paint with an
  explicit `.catch` (same pattern as stores/sync.ts iteration 1); the background task
  (`rescheduleAllNotificationsFromBackground`) still awaits (process stay-alive).
  perfMark/perfMeasure 'widget_push' moved inside the deferred task (marks preserved).
  Test infra: `global.requestAnimationFrame` polyfill added to shared/__mocks__/react-native.ts
  (node test env lacks it; RN provides it as a global).
  MEASURED (iOS, marks): sheet_sound_close 654ms → sound_commit **56ms** → widget_push_start
  ~530ms after commit (post-paint) → widget_push total 1383ms completes off the interaction
  path. Android: close 254ms, sound_commit 157ms, widget_push 0ms (Platform no-op, deferred).
  Idle unchanged (9.6% Android reading post-iteration-5 build family). jest 925/925, biome +
  tsc clean. Both devices rebuilt gate-ON (Android 04:20:27).
  HARNESS: iOS sound-sheet swipe dismiss needs a FAST flick from the handle (140ms drag to
  780) — slow swipes get eaten by the scrollable content (documented session-3, confirmed);
  pymobiledevice3 syslog live sometimes attaches late — verify Athan{React} lines exist before
  driving the interaction.

- 2026-09-06 (session 4, iteration 5): unmount closed-Overlay subtree (#3).
  CHANGE: components/overlay/Overlay.tsx — latched mount: `mounted` state starts false (closed),
  the open transition sets it true immediately, the close transition holds the subtree through
  the fade-out (setTimeout(ANIMATION.duration) = 200ms) then unmounts; `if (!mounted) return
  null`. Open/close animations stay 1:1 (fade-out completes before unmount); the closed overlay
  no longer keeps SVG glow + LinearGradient + a per-second Countdown render alive.
  MEASURED: Android idle process **16.1%** steady (main 10%, JS <1%) vs ~20-24% pre-#3;
  cumulative idle: 80.6% → 16.1%. overlay_open 155ms Android / 52ms iOS — includes the fresh
  mount and is FASTER than the always-mounted builds (180/34 JS-commit — less commit
  contention). overlay_close 186/66ms (fade + unmount). Overlay content verified on-screen
  (89% gradient coverage pixel check); countdown granularity correct (minute display static in
  2s window). js_to_content unchanged (934 Android / 126 iOS). jest 925/925, biome + tsc clean.
  Both devices rebuilt gate-ON (Android 04:11:59).

- 2026-09-06 (session 4, iteration 4): sound-sheet row re-renders (#6).
  ROOT CAUSE: BottomSheetSound passed the whole `useAudioPlayerStatus` object to every
  SoundItem (`status={status}`); the status object changes identity many times per second
  during preview playback → all 32 rows re-rendered per tick (session-3's render-side finding).
  CHANGES: SoundItem now takes PRIMITIVE props (`remainingSeconds` whole-seconds + `isAudible`
  boolean), computed at sheet level (Math.floor(duration − currentTime)); component wrapped in
  React.memo. A status tick now re-renders only the playing row, and only when its displayed
  countdown second changes. showCountdown semantics preserved (isPlaying && isAudible &&
  remaining > 0 ≡ old isPlaying && status.playing && remaining > 0).
  MEASURED: Android warm sheet_sound_open 298ms (session-3: 834 mixed); iOS cold open 873ms
  (first present builds 32 rows — mount-bound, one-time per session); iOS CPU DURING playback:
  1 Running sample / 1789 in an 8s Time Profiler trace ≈ 0% (was the 32-row re-render storm).
  BEHAVIOR VERIFIED (Android, marks + pixels + owner-audible on iOS): select taps fire
  (sound_select_tap ×N), play tap fires (sound_play_tap), playing row's m:ss countdown ticks
  during playback (pixel diffs at the row's text line), clip-finished clears the playing row,
  pause icon state flips. NOTE: play tap restart after a finished clip once failed to restart
  audio (2nd tap of same row) — PRE-EXISTING single-player quirk, untouched code path, logged
  for a future pass. jest 925/925, biome + tsc clean. Both devices rebuilt gate-ON.
  HARNESS: Android sound-sheet first row sits at y≈48% of screen height (sheet 80% + header +
  card + hint), play icon x≈90%; strays during blind tap-hunting changed temp selection +
  scrolled settings — force-stop before each scripted interaction to reset sheet/scroll state.

- 2026-09-06 (session 4, iteration 3): tick consolidation (#4) + hot-path pino gating (#7 TICK half).
  CHANGES: (a) hooks/useCountdown.ts — rewritten to SUBSCRIBE to the store countdown atoms
  (getCountdownAtom) instead of running its own wall-clock timer chain per mounted Countdown;
  the store sequence tickers already update those atoms with identical ceil values on the same
  :000-aligned cadence. 3 hook tickers eliminated (std page, extra page, overlay instance);
  isReady stays derived from nextPrayerAtom; getSecondsRemaining clamps ≥1 so the transition
  hold-at-1s behavior is identical via the atom. (b) stores/countdown.ts — overlay store ticker
  is now ON-DEMAND: startCountdowns() calls resetOverlayCountdown() (placeholder atom, no timer);
  toggleOverlay starts it on open / resets on close; the sequence-ticker auto-close path also
  resets it (was a would-be leak). (c) stores/overlay.ts — toggleOverlay wires the start/reset.
  (d) hooks/usePrayerAgo.ts — per-second setState now bails out (returns prev) when the ago
  text/minutes/isReady are unchanged → page re-renders drop from 1/s to 1/min per page.
  (e) #7: deleted the per-second debug call sites logger.debug('TICK') ×2 (countdown.ts) and
  'TICK: hook' (useCountdown.ts); kept 'TICK: transition' (fires ~11×/day). MMKV read/write
  debug lines NOT idle-path — folded into #8. Test: stores/__tests__/overlay.test.ts mock
  extended with resetOverlayCountdown.
  MEASURED (3T idle, foreground, settled): process 43.7% → **19.3%** (baseline 80.6%); main
  thread ~20-24%; JS 3.4% (baseline 24.1%); TICK log lines 6/s → **0**; timer chains at idle
  6 → **2**. js_to_content unchanged (956-999 — not a startup change). iOS: js_to_content 200ms
  (134-200 band, no regression), 0 TICK lines, widget pushes still post-content.
  BEHAVIOR VERIFIED: hero countdown ticks per second (screencap pixel-diff 490 diffs/3s in hero
  region — with showSeconds toggled ON for visibility); overlay on-demand ticker ticks while
  open (947 diffs/3s) and leaves NO residual burn after close (process 19.3% post-close);
  overlay close + prayer-row fallback countdown (29h tomorrow-Fajr on iOS WDA) correct; toggle
  preferences work; jest 925/925, biome + tsc clean.
  HARNESS GOTCHAS (new): (1) Android 9 uiautomator dump serves STALE accessibility trees —
  live-text assertions MUST use screencap pixel-diffs (PNG unfilter + region compare), not AX
  dumps; (2) `am start -W` ThisTime right after an install is inflated by dexopt (~4.9s) —
  always discard the first post-install launch; (3) dumpsys cpuinfo percentages are
  lifetime-cumulative after many relaunches — use `top -n N -d 5` medians; (4) multiple
  aborted+retried Maestro toggle flows silently double-flip boolean prefs — verify final state
  from the app surface (pixels), never assume toggle history.
  REMAINING idle burn (~19%): 2 store tickers + 3 Countdown renders/s + bar per-second update +
  surfaceflinger — next lever is #10 (render only when displayed string changes when showSeconds
  off → per-minute renders).

- 2026-09-06 (session 4, iteration 2): Android idle CPU — invisible-animation gating (#5 promoted
  over #4/#7 by measurement: main thread 93.1% >> JS thread 24.1%).
  CHANGES: (a) components/ui/RamadanDecorations.tsx — the animation-arming useEffect now early-
  returns when `!visible` (isRamadan && decorationsEnabled): it previously armed ~13 infinite
  withRepeat(-1) loops (3 bobs, 3 glows, lantern flicker, 3 cloud drifts, moon bob, moon glow
  pulse) that ticked Reanimated at 60fps while the component rendered null for ~10 months/year.
  (b) components/countdown/Bar.tsx — deleted `tipPulse` (dead infinite withRepeat consumed by NO
  animated style — a phantom 60fps Choreographer loop) and stopped animating width per second:
  the per-second withTiming(1000ms linear) animated `width`% + tip `left` (Yoga LAYOUT props →
  relayout every frame) for a SUB-PIXEL change (a 1s step of a multi-hour countdown moves the
  bar <0.1px). Small steps now direct-set widthValue; the visible >50% transition refill keeps
  TIMING_CONFIG_FAST; boundary color transitions keep withTiming. Bar verified rendering
  post-change via screenshot pixel check (646 bar-yellow pixels) + toggle pref restored ON.
  MEASURED (3T, app foreground idle, screen on): main thread 93.1% → 76.6% (after a) →
  **16.6%** (after b); process 80.6% → **43.7%** (top) / 20% (dumpsys window). JS thread
  24.1% → 3.3% (was inflated by animation-frame bridge traffic). gfxinfo: 3 frames/6s before
  AND after (UI static — burn was Choreographer/animation, not rendering). Residual 16.6% main
  + ~24% spread = per-second tick render churn (6 tick sources/s) + native view updates →
  iteration 3 (#4/#7). iOS: rebuilt + reinstalled; 10s Time Profiler attach shows effectively
  zero Running samples (≤~1% core) — iOS was never the idle headline (A12 absorbs it).
  METHOD NOTES: atrace text trace was the key profiler (359 Choreographer#doFrame+animation
  sections in 6s on main = 60fps loop); uiautomator does NOT expose the custom progressbar or
  LabeledToggle state on Android — verify bar via screencap pixel count; Maestro driver died
  mid-session (stale connection) — relaunch flow or use uiautomator dump. Jest 925/925 green,
  biome + tsc clean. Builds rebuilt gate-ON both devices (Android 03:15:28, iOS reinstalled).

- 2026-09-06 (session 4): Phase 3 iteration 1 COMPLETE — iOS startup widget-push defer.
  CHANGE (stores/sync.ts only): `sync(options)` takes `deferWidgetRefresh`; the startup atom
  passes true; `initializeAppState` then fires `refreshPrayerWidgets()` via rAF + setTimeout(0)
  (past first paint) with an explicit `.catch` — BG-task + foreground-listener callers still
  await (process-stay-alive + non-gated paths unchanged).
  ROOT CAUSE (from marks + pino timeline): iOS cold start's ~1.2s gap between sync-data-done and
  home_content was the WIDGET TIMELINE BUILD+PUSH running at sync completion and saturating the
  JS thread (~570ms Standard + ~530ms Extras, serial). First attempt (plain fire-and-forget,
  no rAF) measured NO improvement (1361 median ×5) — proof the await was never the blocker,
  the WORK PLACEMENT was: the build competes with React's first content commit either way;
  rAF+setTimeout lands it after the paint. js_to_content 1361→134ms median (×5: 133-177).
  MEASURED AFTER: Android 996-1020 / ThisTime 3512-3642 (no change — Platform-guard no-op;
  rebuilt anyway per protocol). iOS behavior verified via WDA AX (home rows render) + widget
  pushes still complete post-content (Standard 347-348 entries, Extras 326).
  FINDINGS (documented, no action): (1) iOS pushes widget timelines TWICE per cold start —
  sync's push + `initWidgetSettingsSync`'s debounced initial re-push ~2.5s later (≈2.2s of
  redundant A12 JS burn; widget.ts is measure-only this campaign — candidate for owner action
  or a future campaign). (2) BUILD CONFOUND: campaign Release builds are dev-env
  (`EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV` unset → isDev → mock API): every launch runs the full mock data-refresh
  pipeline (clearAllExcept + ~12-day rewrite, ~175ms Android / 14ms iOS) that production never
  does. Baseline + all campaign builds share the env → iteration deltas stay valid; do NOT
  compare absolute startup numbers to production expectations. Home screen confirmed showing
  mock cascade (Fajr 00:30 etc.). (3) Startup decomposition Android (cold): 60ms native + 780ms
  bundle + ~395ms module-eval (Running main → perf_monitor_init; SD820 Hermes) + 175ms mock
  refresh + ~70ms sequences + ~320-690ms first content commit + ~260ms notification/BG init
  (post-content). Android startup levers left: module-eval trim + chrome defer (sheets/Overlay/
  modals) — queued behind #4/#7 which burn CPU 24/7.
  Jest 925/925 green; biome + tsc clean. Builds rebuilt gate-ON on BOTH devices (Android
  installed 02:55:06; iOS reinstalled after rAF refinement).

- 2026-09-06 (session 3): Phase 2 COMPLETE — instrumentation built, validated on both physical
  devices, zero-cost verified. Evidence: baseline/2-instrumentation-validation.md.
  WHAT SHIPPED (code): react-native-performance@6.0.0 dep; shared/perf.ts (gate/ring/MMKV/pino);
  marks in: app/_layout (init), app/index (js_to_content), Sheet.tsx (perfName prop; open/close
  measures; screens pass sheet_settings/sound/alert), stores/ui.ts (present marks),
  stores/overlay.ts + Overlay.tsx (open/close), Navigation.tsx (pager drag/settle),
  LabeledToggle (toggle_tap + label detail), SoundItem (select/play taps), Sound.tsx
  (sound_commit), notifications.ts withSchedulingLock (enqueue/queue_wait/duration + widget_push
  at the caller). Tests: shared/__tests__/perf.test.ts (7) + react-native-performance jest mock +
  AppState added to react-native mock.
  KEY VALIDATION NUMBERS (in-app vs external): iOS js_to_content 1451ms (= baseline 1.1-1.6s gap),
  sheet open 729-770 (bias-corrected ext ✓), pager 204, overlay JS-commit 34ms(!); Android
  js_to_content 1077 (cold 3563≈3668 baseline), sheet open 416 median ×20, overlay open 180 ×10,
  sound sheet open 834, sound_commit 117 (reschedule 74, queue_wait 1, widget_push 0).
  NEW INSIGHTS: (1) iOS baseline "sheet open ×20" was iteration-1 + 19 toggle-tap false
  positives (harness close_sheets swipe eaten by scrollable content — marks caught it); true
  sheet open ≈730-770ms. (2) Overlay/sound-sheet pain is RENDER-side, not JS-commit (34ms/180ms
  commits) — backlog #3/#6 confirmed as render work. (3) Android pager gesture pipeline is 16ms;
  38% swipe jank = page render.
  LIBRARY GOTCHAS (react-native-performance@6.0.0, all handled in perf.ts): iOS native marks are
  on a skewed timeline (never mix native↔JS in one measure — only launch_native/launch_js_bundle
  native↔native are derived); ring `ts` = recording wall-clock ± observer batch lag (durations
  exact); measure() throws on missing marks (guarded); default export via require().default.
  **METRO CACHE IS ENV-BLIND: toggling EXPO_PUBLIC_PERF_MONITOR requires
  `rm -rf node_modules/.cache/metro` + delete the generated bundle or the stale transform ships
  (cost us a false OFF build; ON-restored after). Also gradle marks the bundle task UP-TO-DATE
  when only env changes — delete android/app/build/generated/assets/react/release/index.android.bundle
  to force.**
  HARNESS FIXES NEEDED (Phase 4): iOS close_sheets swipe (eaten by scrollable sheets); Android
  logcat must STREAM (-v threadtime > file) during flows — post-hoc -d dumps lose entries to the
  TICK debug flood; overlay-suite taps at fixed y can land between rows (verify via mark
  presence).
  NEXT (Phase 3): iterate backlog with marks as primary measurement — startup (#1), Android
  idle CPU (#4/#7), sound-sheet render (#6), overlay subtree (#3), sheet-dismiss burst (#2).
  Re-measure BOTH devices per iteration; jest green per iteration.

- 2026-09-05 (session 2): Phase 1 COMPLETE — full baseline captured, no code changes.
  Key results (details in baseline/baseline.md):
  - Android idle CPU 49% (dumpsys) / 90% (top) — headline.
  - Cold start: Android 3668ms / iOS 2693ms-to-content (system floor only 623-796ms).
  - Android jank per suite: overlay 69.9% > sounds 66.4% (spam 89.3%!) > sheets 43.1% >
    swipes 37.6% > toggles 24.4%. Zero ANRs/input loss anywhere.
  - iOS sheet/overlay open ~2110ms WDA-median (≈1.3-1.6s after harness-bias correction);
    pager 1005ms; toggle/sound spam doubles /source AX latency (2s vs 1s idle).

  HARNESS LESSONS: Maestro MCP driver dies on long flows + stale-handle — use Maestro CLI
  (`--device <udid>`, flow needs `---` header separator); raw adb input for true spam
  (Maestro paces). WDA tap POST RTT ≈550ms, /source ≈1.0s idle (2.0s under load) — iOS
  absolute latencies carry this bias, deltas valid. iOS sheet content AX-invisible in
  Release — assert on chrome (`Bottom sheet handle`); Android-layout coords scale to iOS
  proportionally (sheet top 30% both). xctrace App Launch terminates the app on completion
  (relaunch before attach-profiling). App Launch template works on physical device via
  `--launch -- <bundle-id>`.
  TOOLS STATE: WDA held by detached `xcodebuild test` (survives restarts) + usbmux
  forward 8100 — check `curl localhost:8100/status` after any restart. Baseline harnesses
  in /var/folders/.../T/opencode/ (ios-launch-timing.py, ios-interactions.py, ios-spam.py,
  *.yaml suites) — NOT in repo (scratch); replicate into e2e/ during Phase 4.
  NEXT (Phase 2): react-native-performance@6 dep + shared/perf.ts ring buffer +
  EXPO_PUBLIC_PERF_MONITOR gate; validate marks against these external numbers.

- 2026-09-05 (session 1): Plan approved (5 questions answered: branch exception granted; permanent
  env-gated instrumentation; Release-first; iOS widgets out of scope; install everything).
  Branch created. CLIs installed (Maestro 2.10.0, Flashlight, xcodebuildmcp@2.7.0 via npx,
  pymobiledevice3@11.3.1 at `~/.venvs/pymobiledevice3/bin/pymobiledevice3`). Android keep-awake
  set (`svc power stayon usb`). `app.config.ts`: env-driven name suffix added (defaults
  byte-identical). `opencode.json`: Maestro MCP + XcodeBuildMCP added (active after opencode
  restart). AGENTS.md §6 AI Tooling: Maestro + Flashlight documented. iOS signing set up by
  owner in Xcode (Team `9V3WAU9Z54`, cert "Apple Development: Mugtaba Subahi (9ZU4ASVJSS)");
  built-in Xcode MCP enabled by owner (Intelligence → Allow external agents) but no port found
  yet — optional, XcodeBuildMCP covers it.
  **Build in flight at session end (both detached, survive restart):**
  - Android: `EXPO_ANDROID_SUFFIX=perf EXPO_NAME_SUFFIX=perf npx expo run:android --variant release`
    → log `/tmp/athan-android-release.log`. First attempt failed: `android/` was STALE (1.15.0-era
    prebuild — `expo run` does not re-prebuild; repo gotcha). Fixed: explicit
    `npx expo prebuild -p android --no-install` with suffix env → applicationId
    `com.mugtaba.athan.perf`, versionName 1.18.9 verified. Rebuild running.
    APK path: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`. Install clash context:
    device has Play `com.mugtaba.athan` + campaign `com.mugtaba.athan.bgtest` (do not touch).
  - iOS: `xcodebuild -workspace ios/Athan.xcworkspace -scheme Athan -configuration Release
    -destination 'platform=iOS,id=00008020-0015585C22D2002E' -allowProvisioningUpdates
    -derivedDataPath ios/build` → log `/tmp/athan-ios-release.log`. After build: install via
    `xcrun devicectl device install app --device 4662382A-D15D-5EF7-8425-FCDC0B3694BC
    ios/build/Build/Products/Release-iphoneos/Athan.app` (replaces the TestFlight install,
    same bundle id `com.mugtaba.athan` — owner approved).
  **Resume protocol (post-restart, execute IN ORDER):**
  1. Check build logs `/tmp/athan-android-release.log` (Android: `npx expo run:android --variant
     release` was relaunched after purge, ORIGINAL id `com.mugtaba.athan` v1.18.9, prebuild
     re-run clean) and `/tmp/athan-ios-release.log` (xcodebuild Release, original id, Team
     `9V3WAU9Z54`, `-derivedDataPath ios/build`). If a build died mid-flight, relaunch it
     detached with nohup + same command, keep polling ≤15s cycles.
  2. Install: Android should auto-install via expo run (verify
     `adb -s 8f7ada76 shell pm list packages | grep mugtaba`). iOS:
     `xcrun devicectl device install app --device 4662382A-D15D-5EF7-8425-FCDC0B3694BC
     ios/build/Build/Products/Release-iphoneos/Athan.app`.
  3. Re-assert Android keep-awake: `adb -s 8f7ada76 shell svc power stayon usb`.
  4. Smoke-launch both apps (Android `com.mugtaba.athan`, iOS `com.mugtaba.athan`); grant any
     permission prompts (Maestro/mobile-mcp can tap system dialogs). Verify Maestro MCP sees
     both devices (`maestro devices` or MCP `list_devices`).
  5. Proceed to **Phase 1 baseline** (see checklist above; method in the plan section below).
     iPhone XS Auto-Lock → Never: DONE (owner confirmed). Never reboot devices. iOS widgets /
     notification semantics untouched. Owner commits manually; version bump is owner's ritual.

- 2026-09-05 (session 2): Resume protocol executed. iOS build SUCCEEDED (+codesign keychain
  prompts: owner clicked "Always Allow" — fixed repeating prompts). Installed on XS via
  devicectl (com.mugtaba.athan). Android build #3 had FAILED at
  `:app:configureCMakeRelWithDebInfo[armeabi-v7a]` — orphaned ninja/clang PIDs from killed
  build #2 held `.cxx` open (lsof found them; kill -9 + `rm -rf android/app/.cxx/RelWithDebInfo`).
  Build #4 SUCCEEDED, auto-installed on 3T (versionName 1.18.9 verified). Keep-awake
  re-asserted. **iOS AUTOMATION CAVEAT: Maestro does NOT support physical iOS devices** (docs
  confirmed; "Apple account team ID" error is a dead end — driver is simulator-only). Android
  drives fine via Maestro (MCP `inspect_screen` works on 8f7ada76). iOS interaction stack =
  **pymobiledevice3 `developer wda`** (tap/swipe/list-items/launch/screenshot via WebDriverAgent)
  + `xctrace` for profiling + `pymobiledevice3 syslog` for logs. WDA cloned to
  /tmp/opencode/WebDriverAgent and building onto the XS (Team 9V3WAU9Z54, log /tmp/wda-build.log)
  at time of this entry. NOTE: opencode's model cannot view screenshots/images — verify UI via
  AX trees / text assertions; save screenshots for the owner to review. Owner constraint
  reaffirmed: NO store/TestFlight/EAS production deploys — Release builds stay local.
  **WDA OUTCOME (same session): facebook/WebDriverAgent master is DEAD on Xcode 26** (stale
  -Werror breakage + `XCTAutomationSupport` now a restricted framework → linker fail).
  **appium/WebDriverAgent fork builds and runs fine** — THAT is the one to use. Setup (one-time,
  already done): clone appium/WebDriverAgent → /var/folders/.../T/opencode/WebDriverAgent
  (NOTE: /tmp/opencode in earlier notes = this dir), `brew install carthage` (only needed by
  facebook fork — appium fork needs NO bootstrap), then:
  `nohup xcodebuild -project WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj -scheme WebDriverAgentRunner
   -destination 'platform=iOS,id=00008020-0015585C22D2002E' -derivedDataPath wda-build
   DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=9V3WAU9Z54 -allowProvisioningUpdates test > /tmp/wda-build.log 2>&1 &`
  WAIT for `ServerURLHere->` in the log, then:
  `nohup ~/.venvs/pymobiledevice3/bin/pymobiledevice3 usbmux forward 8100 8100 &`
  Drive via HTTP on localhost:8100: POST /session (appium:bundleId com.mugtaba.athan),
  POST /session/$SID/wda/apps/launch, GET /source (AX XML tree — parse labels),
  POST /session/$SID/actions (W3C pointer tap by coordinates — find-element fails on system
  alerts; parse frame from /source and tap center). Verified end-to-end: granted the notif
  permission alert and read the home screen tree. WDA session lives as long as the xcodebuild
  test process runs (nohup-detached, survives restarts). Harness note: WDA's own device CPU
  cost is constant across baseline + iterations, so deltas stay valid.


- 2026-09-05 (session 1 end): Owner purged ALL Athan apps from both devices (list in Phase 0
  checklist) and chose the ORIGINAL app id for both platforms (the earlier `.perf` suffix plan
  was killed mid-build and superseded). Android re-prebuilt clean (`com.mugtaba.athan`
  v1.18.9) + Release build relaunched detached; iOS Release build still running (started before
  purge — it now installs onto a clean device). iOS Auto-Lock → Never: DONE. Handoff rule added
  at top of file. Owner restarting opencode to activate Maestro MCP + XcodeBuildMCP. Resume via
  the protocol above.
  ANDROID BUILD HISTORY (know this): post-purge build #2 FAILED at
  `:app:createBundleReleaseJsAndAssets` — hermesc exit 6, 1m58s in (JS bundle compile step;
  suspected stale Metro daemon from a pkill'd earlier run). Build #3 relaunched after killing
  all metro/expo processes — CHECK ITS OUTCOME FIRST in `/tmp/athan-android-release.log`.
  If it fails again at the same task: (1) `pkill -f metro; rm -rf /tmp/metro-*`
  `android/app/build`, (2) retry `nohup npx expo run:android --variant release`; (3) if STILL
  failing, run the task verbose (`cd android && ./gradlew :app:createBundleReleaseJsAndAssets
  --info`) and capture the real hermesc stderr before touching anything else. The same JS
  bundled successfully earlier this session (2605 modules) — the code is fine; suspect
  environment/caching.
