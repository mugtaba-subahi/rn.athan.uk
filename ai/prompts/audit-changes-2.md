# Next session: code audit, the changes (part 2 of task 20)

Read `ai/AGENTS.md` first, act as Orchestrator. This continues task 20, which session 4 started
on 2026-09-12 and did not finish. Everything in `ai/prompts/audit-changes.md` still applies:
read it as well, it is the governing brief. This file records what changed since, so the next
session does not re-derive it.

## Where things stand

`uat-2` is at **1.25.30**. Twenty four version-bumped commits landed, each on its own branch,
merged `--no-ff`, pushed. The suite is **43 suites, 1035 tests**, up from 42/1015 and never down.

**Eighteen numbered findings are closed with code.** The full table, the four new findings and
the two corrections are at the end of `ai/features/uat-2/AUDIT-FINDINGS.md`, under "Session 4,
part 1". Read that section before anything else in the document.

The OnePlus 3T holds a **prod build of 1.25.30**, matching `uat-2` HEAD, with real London data,
Fajr on Sound, one alarm armed and `yarn check:device` green.

## Two owner rulings from the close of session 4. Do not reopen them.

**1. The error screen keeps its single Refresh button, and that button clears the cache.**
*"IT WAS FINE BEFORE. ONE BUTTON. REFRESH. DOES THE RESET. DONT CARE IF ITS DESTRUCTIVE. IT
DOESNT DELETE PREFERENCES."* Finding 6 is withdrawn as a defect. The markup and styles are
byte-identical to where session 4 found them and must stay that way. The owner's second point
settles the objection rather than trading against it: recovering from that screen needs the
network whether or not the cache was wiped, because the next launch retries the same fetch, so
the cached timetable is not something the user currently has. Verified end to end on the 3T:
offline with no cache gives the error screen, Refresh clears, reloads, refetches and the real
London times come back.

**2. KEEP EVERY VISUAL EXACTLY AS IT IS.** *"I TOLD YOU TO KEEP ALL THE VISUALS OF THE APP
EXACTLY THE SAME."* No new buttons, no new copy, no layout changes, no colour changes, in any
fix. If a finding appears to need a visual change, stop and ask. This includes the four
accessibility items in Tier 6: adding roles, labels and states is invisible, but anything that
moves a pixel is not.

**3. The Android notification channels need extreme care.** Owner, at the close of session 4:
*"be extremely careful with the alarm channels on android. we had many many issues making it
work before. they need to properly be 1:1 if you touch them."* This governs **finding 5**,
which is the next step. Channel ids are immutable once created, which is why
`deleteLegacyAndroidAudioChannels` and the `_v2` suffix exist; a channel's sound cannot be
changed after creation, and Android silently drops notifications posted to a channel that does
not exist. Read the whole of `shared/notifications.ts:192-257` and `device/notifications.ts`
before changing a line, keep the channel ids and their sounds exactly as they are, and verify
on the device with `yarn check:device` before and after. If the fix cannot be shown to be 1:1
on channel ids, sounds and importance, do not land it — write it up and ask.

## Four things session 4 learned that change how you should work

**1. `[test]` is not proof.** Finding 2 was marked `CONFIRMED [test]` and was **wrong about the
shipped bundle**. `metro.config.js` sets `inlineRequires: true`, so module evaluation defers to
first use; jest's graph is eager. Measured on device, `stores/notifications.ts` evaluates 5 ms
*after* `handleAppUpgrade` removes the gate key, so the old code worked in Release. Any
remaining finding whose mechanism depends on **when a module first evaluates** must be checked
on the device before you believe it. Finding 4 was re-checked and stands, because its parts
live in one file.

**2. Never build with `EXPO_PUBLIC_PERF_MONITOR=1` on the owner's device casually.** That build
runs the mock API and writes fabricated prayer times into MMKV. Installing a prod build over it
at the same version does **not** clear them (`wasAppUpgraded()` false), and bumping the version
does not either (post-#34 an upgrade only wipes when `cacheSchemaChanged()`). The only recovery
without root is `adb shell pm clear`, which also destroys the alert preferences and needs them
re-entered by hand through the UI. Session 4 hit this and recovered it; budget for that or do
not take the measurement.

**3. The pre-commit hook now works for config files.** Finding 61: `biome.json` ignores
`metro.config.js` and `jest.config.js` while lint-staged fed them to Biome, which errored, so
those files were uncommittable except with `--no-verify` — which skips Biome on everything else
**and** the related-test run. Fixed with `--no-errors-on-unmatched`. Do not reach for
`--no-verify`; if the hook fails now, it has found something.

**4. The version bump touches three files and one is gitignored.** `app.json`, `package.json`
and `android/app/build.gradle`. The last is not tracked, so it never appears in a commit, but it
must stay in step or local device builds ship the wrong `versionName`. Session 4 used a helper
in the scratchpad that bumps all three and verifies they match; rewrite it, it is six lines.

## What is left, in the brief's order

The original prompt's step order still governs. Remaining work, by step:

| Step | Findings | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | **5** | Android's five daily athan channels, never created at schedule time. The highest silent-alarm risk left, and the one the owner has warned about by name. Read ruling 3 above first. Device-verify through `yarn check:device`, which session 4 repaired. |
| 5 | **8**, 47 | One guard in `validateApiResponse` closes both, and closes finding 6's escape-hatch question with it. |
| 6 | **10, 11, 24, 22, 26, 21** | Cheap guards. Each is a small test. |
| 7 | 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 27, 48, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57 | The rest of Tier 2, in document order. |
| 8 | 34, 36 | The rest of Tier 3. 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35 are done. |
| 9 | **44**, 46 | Tier 5. 44 is the one that matters and is fixable today. 43 is a note. 45 is withdrawn. |
| 10 | a-aa, plus the four accessibility items | Tier 6. 52 and 53 lead it. |
| — | 37, 38, 39, 41 | Tier 4 iOS widgets, behind the off flag. The brief recommends doing these four and leaving 40 and 42 recorded. |

Findings **1** and **45** are settled and need no work. Finding **9** is resolved by the owner's
ruling but keeps a live fix direction: an `env` block in `eas.json` stating the contract the
dashboard already provides, plus a config-time failure when the environment is prod or preview
and the key is absent or still the placeholder.

## Device and key

The 3T (`8f7ada76`) and nothing else; the iPhone XS stays disconnected. A prod build needs the
real API key passed through shell env, never committed and never written into the repository.
Session 4 kept it at mode 600 in the session scratchpad and verified with a repository-wide
grep that it never reached the tree. Ask the owner for it; do not assume the previous
scratchpad survives, and remember `/tmp` is wiped nightly.

Build ritual that worked, every time:

```sh
rm -rf node_modules/.cache/metro
find android/app/build -name index.android.bundle -delete
export EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV=prod
export EXPO_PUBLIC_API_KEY=$(cat <scratchpad>/.api_key)
./android/gradlew -p android assembleRelease
adb -s 8f7ada76 install -r android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

Verify the APK before trusting it: `unzip -p app-release.apk assets/app.config` for the version,
and the bundle md5 against the previous build. An identical md5 is correct only when the
JavaScript genuinely did not change.

## The bar, unchanged

This app is an alarm clock. A prayer time two minutes wrong is a bug; a notification on the
wrong night is a serious one. One finding, one branch, one commit. The whole suite passes
before and after every commit and never goes down. Never edit a test to make it pass. Break a
fix deliberately to prove its test bites, which session 4 did for every fix that had one.
