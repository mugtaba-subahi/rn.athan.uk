## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

1. First Launch:
   - Fetch entire year's prayer times from API
   - Strip historical dates (before today)
   - Add Duha prayer (20 mins after sunrise)
   - Cache processed data in MMKV storage

2. Daily Operations:
   - Load current day's prayers from cache
   - Track prayer states (passed/next/upcoming)
   - Manage notifications based on user preferences
   - Reset at midnight for new day

3. Year Transition:
   - Detect last prayer (Isha) of year
   - Automatically fetch next year's data

### Timer System

- Main timer: Counts down to next prayer
- Overlay timer: Shows time until selected prayer
- Both timers sync with system clock
- Notification scheduling based on prayer times

### Notification System

Notifications are scheduled:
- For each prayer time
- Maintains consistency even when app is closed
- Automatically schedules next day's Fajr after Isha
- Persists through app restarts
