# device-checks — one command, run on demand: what the phone ACTUALLY has armed.
#
# Reports build identity, notification channels, permissions and every alarm the
# app has scheduled, and FAILS on the things that silently break an alarm clock:
# nothing armed, a missing channel, or a trigger that is not a prayer time.
#
# Usage: device-checks.sh [device-serial] [package] [expected-times.json]
#
# expected-times.json (optional) is a JSON list of "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM" strings —
# the moments the app should be firing at. When given, every future alarm must
# match one, or sit one of the reminder intervals ahead of one. Which prayers are
# armed is a user preference, so an expected time with no alarm is not a failure.
# Generate it from the timetable the app is using (see e2e/README.md). No API key
# is read, passed or stored by this script.
#
# Alarm TIMES are only meaningful on a PRODUCTION build: local/dev builds run the
# mock API, whose prayers sit a few minutes either side of launch and have
# usually already fired. Everything else here is build-agnostic.
#
# Exit status: 0 all checks passed, 1 at least one FAIL.
